www.npr.org,"Columbia bows to Trump administration, hoping to restore federal funding",https://gothamist.com/news/columbia-bows-to-trump-administration-hoping-to-restore-federal-funding,"Columbia University bowed to many of President Donald Trump’s demands on Friday in a bid to restore$400 million in federal funding. Columbia's interim President Katrina Armstrong announced she will ban masks on campus, with exemptions for health or religious reasons, train three-dozen campus police officers with authority to arrest people, and appoint a new senior vice provost who will conduct a “thorough review” of the Middle East studies department. The moves came amid unprecedented pressure on the Ivy League university from the White House. Earlier this month, the federal education department moved to terminate $400 million in federal funding for Columbia, citing what it called ""relentless violence, intimidation and antisemitic harassment"" on campus. Federal education officials then sent Columbia a detailed list of demands for the funding to be restored. A pro-Palestinian student protest movement disrupted campus life at Columbia after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and the start of Israel’s war in Gaza. Many of the student protesters have worn masks, citing a fear ofonline harassment or doxxing. The federal demands were met with alarm by many in academia, who feared that they would stifle thefree discussion of ideasthat is central to higher education. As part of the new announcement, Columbia wrote on its website that it would develop new coursework for Middle East studies and embark on a “larger mapping” of offerings to ensure they adhere to standards of “excellence and fairness.” The effort will involve the new senior vice provost, who will also have authority over the Center for Palestine Studies, the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, South Asian studies and African studies. “The way Columbia and Columbians have been portrayed is hard to reckon with. We have challenges, yes, but they do not define us,” Armstrong wrote. “At all times, we are guided by our values, putting academic freedom, free expression, open inquiry, and respect for all at the fore of every decision we make.”",2025-03-22 00:35:19

He was 76. Foreman's family announced his death on social media. ""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,"" his family wrote. ""A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family."" A native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt in one of the greatest fights ever staged. Foreman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening. He then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history in 1994, flooring Michael Moorer — 19 years his junior — with one perfect combination to claim Moorer's two heavyweight belts. Foreman's transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor. He was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, a simple cooking machine which sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did. ""George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,"" Top Rank president Bob Arum said. ""We've lost a family member and are absolutely devastated."" In the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success. Foreman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston's Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing as a teenager. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance. Acting heavyweight world champion George Foreman gimmicks with a playful punch closing an eye, as he arrives at the airport in Hamburg, Germany, on February 7, 1995.Michael Probst/AP Photohide caption Foreman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time. He stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!"" Foreman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the ""rope-a-dope"" strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round. Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade as a preacher after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a title fight in 1991. Three years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas. Moorer appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in spectacular fashion.Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023. Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman. ""Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. ""His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.""",2025-03-22 00:35:21
www.npr.org,Voice of America staff sue Trump administration for shutting down network,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336351/voice-of-america-trump-lawsuit-kari-lake-voa,"David Folkenflik Staff at the government broadcaster Voice of America have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, which put nearly 900 employees on leave and froze funding last week.BONNIE CASH/AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption Six Voice of America journalists sued Kari Lake and the Trump administration on Friday, alleging their moves to shut down the U.S.-funded network were unlawful and unconstitutional. The journalists say that the government's acts violate their First Amendment rights on free speech grounds and usurp the U.S. Congress's control of the power of the federal purse. More than 900 full-time network employees were placed on indefinite leave last weekend; 550 contractors were terminated from their jobs. Most employees at the federal parent, U.S. Agency for Global Media, were also placed on indefinite leave. The lead plaintiffs include Patsy Widakuswara, until recently Voice of America's White House bureau chief and Jessica Jerreat, its press freedom editor. Four other journalists sued anonymously as John Does. Kathryn Neeper, thedirector of strategy and performance assessmentat the U.S. Agency for Global Media, is also a named plaintiff. She was also placed on leave. Few Voice of America journalists are known inside the U.S.; the network is prohibited from broadcasting to American audiences. Nonetheless, Widakuswara made headlines twice: First in pressing Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in early 2021 over the siege of the U.S. Capitol and, earlier this month, in asking Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin about ""the president's plans to expel Palestinians from Gaza"" at an appearance with President Trump at the White House. Irritated, Trump asked Widakuswara what outlet she worked for. Upon hearing the answer, he replied, ""No wonder,"" and called on another reporter. Lake is Trump's special adviser overseeing USAGM. ""Waste, fraud, and abuse run rampant in this agency and American taxpayers shouldn't have to fund it,""Lake said in announcing the moves last weekend. The effect was to shut Voice of America down. The most recent stories on its home page and its audio headlines feed are a week old; live streaming services are unavailable. The suit, which additionally names acting USAGM Chief Executive Victor Morales as a defendant, seeks immediate reinstatement of all full-time staffers and contractors. It points to regulations and law which specify a firewall to insulate Voice of America and the other international networks funded by the agency from political tampering. Those measures are intended to ensure their professionalism. ""Tragically, Kari Lake lives in the MAGA fantasy world, but she makes decisions that have real-world consequences for hundreds of journalists,"" said David Seide, the lead attorney on the suit. Seide is senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, a non-profit that seeks to protect the rights of whistleblowers. ""We've assembled a coalition of journalists, unions, and advocacy groups to stop and reverse the DOGE machine,"" Seide added. Among the other backers of the suit are the press-rights group Reporters Without Borders and unions representing federal employees, journalists, and foreign policy staffers. Lake gave this one-sentence reply to a request for comment for this story: ""Kari Lake does not grant interviews or interact with disreputable 'news' outlets like NPR."" She has not responded to prior efforts seeking interviews. Morales and the agency itself did not respond. Congress has appropriated funds for the Voice of America every year since the broadcaster's founding during World War II. Lawmakers allocated additional money for the broadcaster and other federally funded networks as part of the stopgap spending measure passed last week. In addition to Voice of America, the U.S. Agency for Global Media also oversees Radio/TV Martí, which broadcasts to Cuba. The agency also disburses the money Congress allocates for privately incorporated networks — Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks — as well as the Open Technology Fund, which propels the open-source tech undergirding Signal and other secure communication programs. The networks are intended to serve as a demonstration of soft power in places without a robust or free press. By providing news that incorporates political debate and dissent inside the U.S., the networks aim to promote and model pluralistic American ideals. According to the agency, the networks together reach more than 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week. They are fully funded by federal dollars. The withholding of federal dollars from the non-profit broadcasters has had immediate repercussions. Radio Free Asia on Friday furloughed three-quarters of its U.S.-based staff as it burns through the remaining money it has; Steve Capus, the chief executive of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty toldNPR's Leila Fadel this weekthat without a restoration of funds, the network would face ""pretty drastic actions."" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty sued Lakeand the Trump administration earlier this week; the Open Tech Fund filed suit Thursday. Their suits were filed in the District of Columbia; the Voice of America plaintiffs sued in federal court in Manhattan. The lawsuits are a replay of the litigation that ensued during Trump's first term. His pick to run USAGM, Michael Pack, sought to overhaul the agency.His tenure was marked by one controversy after another; a formal federal investigation found that he had abused his powers. Soon after taking office in mid-2020,Pack sought to deny work visasfor foreign nationals employed by the network. In the newest litigation against Lake, Morales and USAGM, two of the unnamed plaintiffs are described as freelance journalists working under contract to VOA. Each is said in the lawsuit to be a foreign national authorized to work in the U.S. under a J-1 visa; their visas will expire on March 31 if their visas are not renewed and the agency is not operational once more. In that case, they would have to return to their home countries. John Doe 3 would return to a nation under rule by an authoritarian regime that has labeled Voice of America a ""subversive organization,"" according to the lawsuit; the plaintiff risks imprisonment for 15 years. John Doe 4 is described as ""a member of the LGBTQ community and is from a home country which persecutes and discriminates against LGBTQ people."" Lake, a former local TV news anchor in Phoenix, ran twice for statewide office in Arizona as a MAGA Republican candidate. She lost both times. Last month, she became a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Trump initially touted her as the next director of Voice of America but his top budget-slashing adviser, Elon Musk, and other administration officials called for the network to be shut down altogether. Lake has since embraced that charge. ""From top-to-bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer—a national security risk for this nation—and irretrievably broken,"" the agencysaid in its release last Saturday. ""While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.""",2025-03-22 00:35:22

The affected offices, confirmed by DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, are the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. ""These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department's] mission,"" McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations."" The two ombudsman offices provide oversight of the DHS immigration portfolio. This includesdetention, by working with those detained who face issues with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and theU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services(USCIS), to help resolve issues with those seeking immigration-related benefits. ""DHS remains committed to civil rights protections but must streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement,"" McLaughlin said. ""These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department's core mission: border security and immigration enforcement."" Across the government, federal agencies have announced their plans for job cuts as directed by the White House. The latest round of firings, which werefirst reported by Bloomberg, come after an initial round in February focusing primarily on the other parts of the agency that do not handle immigration enforcement. At that time, 405 DHS workers were laid off across cybersecurity, disaster response and science and technology. USCIS lost under 50 employees. Last week, ahead of the cuts, the Democratic ranking members of Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee, which primarily oversee immigration issues,sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemwarning against cuts to the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office, noting that its role is ""statutorily-required."" ""A decision to eliminate the CRCL office or make significant reductions in CRCL staff will jeopardize DHS's ability to comply with statutory requirements and to protect the civil rights and civil liberties of the American people,"" wrote Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.",2025-03-22 00:35:24

These averages are reflective of a larger cultural trend among younger Americans — they're hitting these milestones later in life than previous generations, according toa Pew analysis from 2023. The study, which looked at Census Bureau data, showed that adults under 21 were hitting major life milestones later than adults from 40 years prior. That tracks with the most recentcensus data, which says the median age for first-time marriage in 2024 was 30.2 years for men and 28.6 years for women. In 1974, those respective ages were 23.1 and 21.1.",2025-03-22 00:35:27
www.npr.org,What we know about the case of detained Georgetown professor Badar Khan Suri,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336173/immigration-georgetown-university-professor,"Jaclyn Diaz Healy Hall, the flagship building of Georgetown University's main campus in Washington, D.C., is seen in 2011.Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge has blocked immigration officials from deporting a Georgetown University professor and postdoctoral scholar who was detained by the Trump administration earlier this week. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in Alexandria, Va., said Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, can't be removed from the U.S. ""until the Court issues a contrary order."" Giles' order stopped short of releasing Suri back to his Rosslyn, Va., home where his wife and three young children are still living. His lawyers are still working to get him released. Suri is just the latest scholar to be detained or deported by the Trump administration for their support for Palestinian rights or for criticizing Israel for the war in Gaza. Just like the high-profile arrest ofColumbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil,Suri is being accused by Department of Homeland Security officials of spreading Hamas propaganda. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), saidon X:""Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas."" His lawyers deny this. Attorneys with the Virginia ACLU have said in court filings that the government is retaliating against Suri for his and his wife's support for Palestinians and for the couple's ties to Gaza. ""Ripping someone from their home and family, stripping them of their immigration status, and detaining them solely based on political viewpoint is a clear attempt by President Trump to silence dissent,"" ACLU of Virginia Senior Immigrants' Rights Attorney Sophia Greggsaid in a statement on Suri's case. ""That is patently unconstitutional."" A representative for DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Here's the latest on Suri's case. At the time of his arrest on Monday, Suri was teaching a course and attending Georgetown as a postdoctoral fellow at the university's Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service,according to his bioon the school's website. He's in the U.S. under a J-1 visa, whichaccording to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is for people who take part in approved programs of teaching, studying, training and research. In 2020, Suri completed his Ph.D. in Peace & Conflict Studies from the Nelson Mandela Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia, a public research university in New Delhi. In a statement calling for Suri's release, Georgetown's Alwaleed Center had strong words for the Trump administration. ""[Suri] has committed no crime. Like Mahmoud Khalil before him, he was arrested in the context of a campaign by the Trump Administration to destroy higher education in the United States and punish their political opponents,"" the center said. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, is currently being held in an immigration detention center in Louisiana, according to his lawyers.Andrew C. Condon/Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understandinghide caption Suri's wife, Mapheze Saleh, is a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent and her father is Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to Hamas,according to the Associated Press. YouseftoldThe New York Timesthat his son-in-law wasn't involved in any ""political activism,"" including on behalf of Hamas. Yousef, for his part, has criticized the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and left his role in the Hamas-run government more than a decade ago, theTimessaid. Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown, also told the Associated Press that Suri was focused on teaching and wasn't involved in political activism on the highly prestigious college campus. Suri's attorneys say he and Saleh have faced harassment and threats for speaking out in support of Palestinians and have been featured on sites dedicated to bullying and defaming academics and students involved in the pro-Palestine movement. A photo of Salah and information about her, including her school and former employer is featured on an anonymously run website, Suri's attorneys write in court filings. They said the site ""maintains a blacklist of individuals perceived to support Palestinian rights and is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students."" Suri's plight started March 17, when upon returning home following a Ramadan meal celebration, he was approached by masked federal agents who identified themselves as part of the Department of Homeland Security. They informed him that the government had revoked his visa. ""He is here legally. There was no ongoing issue with his visa,"" Eden B. Heilman,legal director of the ACLU of Virginia, told NPR. The agents quickly took him into custody in front of his wife, Heilman said. But there was never any real explanation to Suri or Saleh about where he was going, what was happening or why, Heilman says. Suri was never charged with any crime. But in just under 72 hours, he has been moved from one immigration center to the next, eventually landing in Louisiana where he is currently held. Both the speed and obscure nature of Suri's arrest ""is really alarming,"" Heilman said. McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of DHS, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio made the determination to remove Suri on March 15, two days before he was arrested.She said on Xthat Rubio determined that Suri's ""activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i)."" The Trump administration is using the same ""rarely used"" federal provision to attempt to remove Suri as they did in the case of Khalil, the former Columbia student,according to the professor's lawyers. This was done ""... to retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Mr. Suri solely for their family ties to those who may have either expressed criticism of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Israel, or who are perceived to hold such critical views imputed to them due to familial relationship."" Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights and and one of Khalil's lawyers, said the use of this policy by the federal government is ""largely unprecedented, save for ugly historical precedents, including the Red Scare and McCarthyism,""theColumbia Spectatorreported. Suri's attorneys are currently working to get him relocated closer to his family, and legal representation, in Virginia, Heilman said.",2025-03-22 00:35:30

On Thursday, hesigned an executive actioninstructing U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education,"" and to do so ""to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law."" Before that, the department had alreadyannouncedit was shrinking its workforce by nearly half, with cuts to all divisions. Meanwhile, the administration has promisedthat ""formula funding"" for schools, which is protected by law, would be preserved. That includes flagship programs like Title I for high-poverty schools, and the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which sends money to rural and low-income schools. But nearly all the statisticians and data experts who work in the office responsible for determining whether schools qualify for that money will soon be out of jobs, making it unclear how such grants would remain intact. At the start of the year, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) employed more than 100 people. On Friday, all but three employees will be placed on administrative leave, and eventually laid off. That's according to multiple NCES employees, who asked that their names not be used because they feared retaliation for speaking out. An internal email obtained by NPR also confirmed how many staff would remain. ""That will have an absolutely devastating impact,"" says Matthew Gardner Kelly, who studies the country's K-12 funding systems at the University of Washington. Since 1867, NCES has been a central, reliable source of information that helps educators, researchers and the public understand the state of education in the United States. A student prepares to leave the Enterprise Attendance Center school in Brookhaven, Miss.Rogelio V. Solis/APhide caption Gardner Kelly says the loss of NCES staff will hit low-income schools especially hard. ""It's not just that loss of information, it's what will happen to a school district's budget in the absence of funds that can't be allocated without the necessary staff at NCES."" NPR reached out to the Department of Education for comment and did not hear back. The federal government only provides a fraction of the money that goes to schools—states and local governments are responsible for the lion's share of that funding. But the federal government plays an outsize role in helping high-needs schools get the money they need to stay afloat. Congress established Title I to provide money to K-12 schools in low-income communities. In the current fiscal year, the Department of Education set aside more than $18.38 billion for Title I. Nearly 90% of U.S. school districts benefit from the program, which has historically enjoyed bipartisan support among lawmakers. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) awards money to low-income and rural school districts. More than a quarter of the country's public schools are in rural areas. And while REAP is a fraction of the size of Title I — $215 million for the current year – Amy Price Azano of Virginia Tech's Center for Rural Education says those dollars stretch much further in rural communities. ""We work with school districts that have 10 people in a graduating class. So when you're talking about enough money to get the one student who needed a paraprofessional to walk across that stage,"" a little bit goes a long way. These federal grants can pay for things like school staff salaries, supplies, technology, tutoring programs and a range of basic services that low-income schools may not otherwise be able to afford. NCES employees told NPR that the cuts to the Education Department likely won't impact REAP or Title I grants for the 2025-26 school year, but the fate of these grants beyond that seems incredibly uncertain. Determining a school district's eligibility for REAP and Title I from one year to the next takes a lot of number crunching. For grants that go to rural schools through the REAP program, NCES plays a direct role in creating the relevant data and providing assistance to local school leaders. For Title I, NCES works with the U.S. Census Bureau to analyze school district boundaries, income levels and other characteristics that help the Department of Education determine grant eligibility. But by the end of the day on Friday, all but three NCES staffers will be locked out of their computers and on administrative leave. ""The key issue is that – as things stand now -- the data needed to drive the next round of Title I, and grants to rural schools, and grants to other programs, isn't going to happen as a result of the cuts to NCES staff and contracts,"" said one former NCES employee. Several employees told NPR that, after the layoffs, it is unlikely the REAP program will be able to get money to schools for the 2026-27 school year. The same goes for Title I, with an added challenge: The Trump administrationis poised to shrinkthe ranks of the Census Bureau. A reduction in its staff could further complicate the distribution of Title I funding. Thursday's executive action lays out the Trump administration's goal of returning ""authority over education to the States and local communities."" At a White House event on Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at closing the U.S. Education Department. He was surrounded by  students sitting in desks and Republican governors.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption But one of the key benefits of grants like Title I and REAP is that while the federal government, including NCES, determines which school districts are eligible, it is ultimately up to local leaders to decide how best to use that money. NCES staff also provide expertise, oversight and guidance to ensure those leaders have what they need to plan budgets effectively for each school year. William Sonnenberg, who is now retired, spent nearly five decades working on Title I for NCES until 2022. ""I don't think it's an exaggeration to say in a given year, I would get thousands of calls from local superintendents or other kinds of people at the school district or at the state level in Title I offices, asking for guidance,"" he says. One NCES employee said, ""Everyone acknowledges three people cannot come anywhere close to fulfilling statutory obligations."" Without data oversight and guidance from NCES, Sonnenberg worries federal grant money may not reach the low-income students who need it most. Rural education expert Amy Price Azano says, while rural schools are used to having fewer resources, the loss of REAP funds will strain them even more. ""They're doing more with less anyway. And so the risk now is that they will have to be even more resilient. They will have to do even more with even less.""

www.npr.org,Review,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5333849/severance-finale-review,"Eric Deggans Mark (Adam Scott) and Helly (Britt Lower).Apple TV+hide caption Severance's Season 2 finale asks a powerful question: If there was another version of you — and that version could help save someone you love by dying — would you ask them to do it? And would that other version of youactuallydo it? These are the wonderfully absurd tensions at the heart of the show's season finale, dubbed ""Cold Harbor."" It's the culmination of a bold progression of episodes that deftly built out the program's depressing, visually arresting world and the hapless characters caught within it – in the process, crafting Apple TV+'s most-watched series globally. The streamer has already announced it's picked up a third season. The premise, for those still catching up, centers on workers for a mysterious, cult-like company called Lumon Industries who have had a medical procedure that severs their work memories from any recollection of what happens outside the office. But instead of providing the perfect work-life balance, those affected are split into two separate consciousnesses — ""innies"" and ""outies."" The world of the innies is mostly confined to a windowless office at Lumon, with days that start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. Helly (Britt Lower).Apple TV+hide caption The show's second season leaned into the notion of innies as an oppressed class, exploring their fight for freedom while pursuing a central mystery. Adam Scott's Mark Scout, who turned to a job on Lumon's ""severed floor"" after his wife, Gemma, died in a car accident, learned she is actually alive and held somewhere inside the company. To find her, Mark had brain surgery, trying to re-integrate his two personalities. When that failed, he found another way, in the second season finale, to initiate a bizarre debate between his inner and outer selves aimed at rescuing his wife – revealing that ""innie"" Mark doesn't really trust his outside personality to be honest or to value his existence. I'm always fascinated by new ways storytellers find to talk about the plight of subjugated people. And the fight for all the ""innie"" personalities at Lumon to somehow free themselves from the company's control – while also hoping for a solution that keeps them from getting erased if their ""outie"" is fired by the company – speaks to the terrible extremes many people oppressed in real life must negotiate. The innies ofSeveranceare a distinctly oppressed class – mostly average folks subjugated by a company whose bizarre rituals were partlyinspired by real-life organizations like the Church of Scientology. But these innies are also betrayed by their own outside counterparts, who prioritize their outside concerns and don't seem to grasp how Lumon's procedure may have created a new form of life. And if you are, like the innies, literally defined by work, what does freedom even look like? As fuel for this trippy tale, director-executive producer Ben Stiller and his crew have developed a creatively distinct and meticulously crafted style for the show – from visuals centered on bleak blues, dark hues and blinding white tones, to an expertly curated soundtrack featuring surprising songs like ""Burnin' Coal"" by Les McCann and a version of ""Windmills of Your Mind"" by Mel Torme. (Severanceis the first TV show in a long time that has inspired me to keep a smartphone with the song-identifying app Shazam handy.) Adding to all this excellence is spot-on casting and wonderfully inspired guest appearances. Scott is doing the best work of his career playing an exasperated, charming everyman in Mark; Britt Lower nimbly navigates the steely rebellion of innie Helly R. and the cold calculation of her outie, company bigwig Helena Eagan. Zach Cherry has leavened his side splitting comedic chops with a poignant take on Dylan G., perhaps the only character who may be more successful inside Lumon than outside. And the scene-stealing performances by Tramell Tillman as tightly-wound company man Seth Milchick remind me of the moment I tuned into a show calledFear the Walking Deadand was riveted by an actor I'd never seen before: Colman Domingo. Dylan (Zach Cherry) and Tramell Tillman (Mr. Milchick).Apple TV+hide caption This season, we've been treated to delightful guest appearances from Sandra Bernhard, Jane Alexander, John Noble, Alia Shawkat, Game of Thronesalum Gwendoline Christie and consummate character actor Bob Balaban. I feel sorry for anybody else trying to get noticed in the Emmys' supporting and guest acting categories this year. (I know: I'm leaving out John Turturro as tortured romantic innie Irving B., Patricia Arquette as icy villain-turned-ally Harmony Cobel, Robby Benson as weird corporate physician Dr. Mauer, Christopher Walken as Irving's love interest Burt G., Dichen Lachman as Mark's missing wife Gemma and many, many more awesome performers). Season 3 of Severance is available upon request.- Tim C.https://t.co/bNig41qs9tpic.twitter.com/cnctZIRDNF Not since the early seasons ofLosthas a TV show so deftly balanced quirky storytelling touches added for style and crucial details needed to understand the unfolding plot. Still, with all its quality,Severance doesn't grapple much with one question: Are these severed staffers truly two different beings in one? Or is each one just a troubled person, deluded by merciless indoctrination and an invasive brain implant into believing they have a divided existence? Given how open-ended this week's episode concludes, I'm hopeful this is an idea they'll explore in their next, truly amazing season. BecauseSeverancehas so far offered a thrilling, smartly-crafted meditation on life, grief, oppression, privilege, class and corporate life with few equals in today's TV landscape. And I can't wait to see where they'll take us next.",2025-03-22 00:36:50
www.npr.org,Review,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333848/the-pitt-episode-12-recap,"Linda Holmes Mohan (Supriya Ganesh), Javadi (Shabana Azeez), Donnie (Brandon Mendez Homer), and McKay (Fiona Dourif).John Johnson/Maxhide caption This is a recap of the 12th episode of the Max medical dramaThe Pitt.Spoilers for that episode obviously abound. For a more general look at the series, check outthis reviewfrom mid-season. There is a moment late in the 12th episode ofThe Pittin which Dr. TrinitySantos, who has spent all day cycling back and forth between swagger and fear, leans down to speak to a woman who's sitting in a wheelchair with a gunshot wound in her arm. Santos checks her dressing, and it looks good. Can she wiggle her fingers? How's the pain? The patient mostly cries. Santos stammers out some reassurance that the bullet probably broke her bones but hasn't hurt the nerves or the arteries, which is a good sign. There is no answer. Eventually, a flummoxed Santos pats her knee briskly and says, ""You're going to be okay."" She leaves to find the next patient. Nurse Donnie, who's been sitting in on this conversation, quietly says to the woman, ""I'll find you some tissues."" There are more dramatic moments in this episode. But this short scene, in which a young doctor on her first day realizes she has no idea what to say to a woman who just survived a mass shooting — realizes thereisnothing to say — is one of the most effective. Robby (Noah Wyle) and Dr. Ellis (Ayesha Harris).John Johnson/Maxhide caption The Pitthas hinted all season that an act of mass violence might be coming. Robby, played so beautifully by Noah Wyle as a man inching ever closer to his breaking point, has been scrapping with McKay over whether to call the police about Theresa's son David after he ran off. Robby didn't want to, but McKay eventually did it anyway, and Robby made it clear he didn't approve. And so, over the course of the very long day that makes up this season, the spectre of horrifying violence has never entirely disappeared, and now, the results of that violence have arrived at the emergency department, although we don't know yet whether there's any connection to David. (Neither does Robby, although note that he goes out of his way to tell the first police officer he sees that he thinks David had something to do with the shooting. So despite Robby's earlier reluctance, he's the one who steps in and tells the police specifically that David might be responsible for this particular shooting and gets the police looking for him.) The shooting took place at PittFest, the music festival where Jake took his girlfriend. As soon as Robby hears what's happened, he's terrified for Jake, who's not answering his phone. But at the same time, he's the boss, and he has to prepare. It's sobering to see just how ready the hospital is for this, how unsurprised. Robby quickly assigns teams to zones, to treat injuries of differing severity. Patients will be triaged and tagged with slap bands out in the ambulance bay. There is an impromptu morgue. Huge plastic bins of extra supplies arrive, but Robby knows they won't be enough. He sends Santos, Whitaker and Javadi to raid central supply for more of everything, continuingThe Pitt's running theme of competition for resources even within the hospital. Dana is the lead person for all the nurses, and she is everywhere: getting supplies from other hospitals, trying to find more blood and helping Robby try to track down Jake. Santos (Isa Briones), Dana (Katherine LaNasa), and Whitaker (Gerran Howell).John Johnson/Maxhide caption Over and over, we get details of what happens when so many people are hurt so quickly. With no time for regular charts, patients will get wrist charts tied on, little more than cards to scribble on with a Sharpie. People will die identified by a little card on a string, with a number and a bar code. Robby has a box of 300 of these wrist charts out in triage. He hopes not to need all of them. One of the waysThe Pitthas leveraged its one hour/one episode format is that people come and go, which helps mix up the energy in a series that's now mostly about doctors and nurses who are already exhausted. The show, like the emergency department, gets some fresh legs, and their personalities come through right away. Dr. Shen (Ken Kirby), the night shift attending, shows up sipping an iced coffee and seems like he might not even be paying attention. But when Robby presses him, it's clear that Shen is plenty sharp; he just manages a crisis in his own way. And when Dr. Ellis (Ayesha Harris) arrives, Robby tells her to ask for help if she needs it. She walks off, looks around, and mutters to herself, ""Help."" Perhaps most important, this episode re-introduces Jack Abbot, another attending we met just briefly in the first episode as Robby talked him down from the roof after a rough night. Shawn Hatosy as Abbot is so, so good here, joining the ensemble seamlessly, which isn't easy in the 12th episode of a 15-episode season. He has an easy authority and confidence, and the fact that he's Robby's closest ally comes through loud and clear. Robby is also relying on Mohan, whose reputation for taking her time doesn't mean she can't act quickly and decisively, which everybody learns right away. Robby (Noah Wyle) and Jack Abbot (Shawn Hatosy).John Johnson/Maxhide caption Less welcome for Robby is the return of Langdon, who Robby sent home a couple of hours earlier after discovering that he'd been stealing benzodiazepines from patients. (Not just from the hospital — from patients who needed them to whom they'd been prescribed, which just seems so much worse.) Hoping Robby will be desperate enough not to dismiss him again, Langdon sneaks in like nothing happened and then refuses to leave when Robby spots him. Robby doesn't have time to argue when Langdon won't go. So this move, which is less good-doing than an awful exploitation of tragedy on Langdon's part to get around his suspension, is successful for now. McKay has her son stashed in the staff lounge when all this starts, because her rotten ex is upstairs having surgery after his goofy skateboarding accident (sigh). But Chad's surgery is canceled on account of the mass casualty protocols, and he ends up wandering downstairs to the emergency department in his hospital gown to look for the kid. When he gets there, he spots McKay working to save a patient, surrounded by all this blood and awfulness, and you get the sense it's maybe the first time he's ever understood what she actually does. McKay (right, Fiona Dourif) and her son (Henry Samiri).John Johnson/Maxhide caption To say this is a hard first day for the newbies — Mel, Whitaker, Santos and Javadi — is an understatement, but they all find their feet. Mel becomes a good leader in her zone, juggling direct patient care but also literally running to follow a mother's request to note on her son's wrist chart that he's deaf, so that they'll know when he wakes up from surgery. Mel also begs to donate blood to her desperate patient — which is very much not protocol, since there's not time to screen for disease. But Robby goes along under the circumstances, and Dana promptly starts a blood donation center for staff who are type O. Desperate times and all. Whitaker excels, too, grabbing the portable ultrasound to figure out that a sneaky liver laceration is why his patient is more unwell than they expected based on her broken leg. And Javadi manages not only to handle her patients and MacGyver a solution to some supply shortages, but also to get her mother out of her hair with a sharp ""Read the f****** room, Mom!"" After her mother walks away, Javadi looks over to McKay for reassurance that this was the right thing to do, and she gets the sly smile she needs. As for Santos, she does good work, but maybe her best moment is catching the creep who faked an injury to get into the emergency department to film. When he (poetically enough) slips on the bloody floor while running from her and briefly knocks himself out, she grabs his phone and ""accidentally"" throws it into a mop bucket. Say this for Santos: Likely from sad experience, she can spot somebody who's up to no good. But that moment late in the episode – when Santos takes a moment with the woman with the wounded arm, who doesn't speak — is so very important. Doctors are running around, nurses are running around, patients are coding and bleeding and being saved from death. And then here is this moment where Santos realizes she's talking to someone who, at the very least, has just watched a lot of people die. The weight of the trauma, which is not just physical but psychological and emotional, is not forgotten. These doctors and nurses, in fact, as hard as they are working, are treating only the first part of what these patients are facing. This series has been exceptional, perhaps the best new show of the last few years, and even though this tragedy was hinted at from the first episode, it's treated with gravity and presented in agonizing detail. The episode ends with no word yet about Jake, and no word about David or anyone else being the shooter or not. There is much work left to do. People are still being driven up to the ambulance bay in the backs of cars and the beds of trucks. There is no word yet on how many more are coming. The day shift was supposed to end at 7:00, but as it turns out, nobody is anywhere near getting to go home.",2025-03-22 00:36:53

Needs work, right? Here's the scoop on this week's most-talked-about movies. In theaters starting Friday The new songs mostly land without being memorable, but Rachel Zegler's spunky, assertive Snow White proves a reasonably refreshing update on 1937's animated princess. CGI dwarfs, not so much. Snow's not waiting for her prince to come this time, she's crushing on a woodsy Robin Hood-type (Andrew Burnap) when she's not plotting to overthrow the evil Queen (Gal Gadot, singing up a storm). Gadot's the spitting image of her animated predecessor, but the character's presence as a petty tyrant interested only in flattery and wealth reads differently this time. In the 1937Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, there's maybe eight minutes of plot spread across 83 minutes of what at the time was truly groundbreaking animation. The new version ditches the animation and half the songs while stretching to 109 minutes, so director Marc Webb, screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, and their teams needed to come up with a lot of story and texture. They've supplied backstory galore, some overdone spectacle, and given their heroine a spine. Even when she's just peering down the castle's wishing well, Zegler's Snow is all about being ""fearless, fair, brave and true."" By the time she's awakened by true love's kiss, she's morphed from a child princess into a cross between Maid Marian and Mary Poppins, and she still has her Eponine/Joan of Arc phase to go. Heigh-ho! In limited theaters starting Friday Eddie (Bill Skarsgård) is a well-meaning screw-up — sweet with his daughter even if he forgets to pick her up after school. But he's also light-fingered, and one day he tries the door of a black SUV that he should have left alone. It's a Dolus (a brand invented for the movie; Dolus is Latin for ""fraud"" or ""deceit""), and it's owned by an angry widower (Anthony Hopkins) who's had his SUV stolen six times, and decided to seek retribution. This SUV is armored, soundproofed, and once Eddie's inside, locked tight. He can't get out. A screen on the dashboard starts berating him. The owner can torment him with excessive air conditioning, electric shocks, yodeling (a few hours is enough to have Eddie begging for mercy), and starvation. And after days of that, the car starts moving. In this remake of theArgentinian movie4x4, filmmaker David Yarovesky and writer Michael Arlen Ross have lots of tricks up their sleeves, including arguments about Marx and Dostoyevsky, not to mention actors who don't need to be in the same space to raise gooseflesh. In limited theaters starting Friday Jessica Palud's poignant if inconclusive biopic examines the turbulent career of Maria Schneider. Wide-eyed Anamaria Vartolomei plays the inexperienced actress, who got the break of her dreams only to suffer serious trauma when she was cast at 19, opposite 48-year-old American icon Marlon Brando inLast Tango in Paris. The first half ofBeing Marialays out Schneider's troubled family relationships, then recreatesLast Tangorehearsals including the scene in which Brando's character humiliates and rapes Schneider's using butter as lubricant. The real-lifeLast Tango in Parisdirector Bernardo Bertolucci said years after filming that he didn't tell Schneider that butter would be used, and Schneidertoldthe Daily Mailin 2007that the scene itself wasn't in the script. Her cousin Vanessa Schneiderwrote about it in a memoirthat Palud has loosely adapted on screen inBeing Maria. Palud, who previously worked with Bertolucci (and,as she said in this Cannes interview, got ahold of a copy ofLast Tango'soriginal shooting script) does her most evocative work in the on-set sequences, with a coddled Brando (a terrific Matt Dillon) and an increasingly vulnerable Schneider. The film's second half feels more routine as the actress spirals into depression and drug use, and it all ends abruptly in 1980, some 30 years and almost as many roles before Schneider's death. In limited theaters starting Friday In Alain Guiraudie's twisty, quasi-comic tale of murder and repression (the title means mercy), Jeremie (Félix Kysyl) returns to his rural French hometown for a mentor's funeral and is soon stirring up all sorts of feelings. When the mentor's wife invites Jeremie to stay for a few days, her adult son unaccountably flies into a jealous rage, the son's best friend hardly knows what to make of Jeremie's flirtatious attention, and the local priest thinks he's figured out why the morel mushrooms (which he usually finds in graveyards) are suddenly growing in a clearing in the woods. As in his award-winningStranger by the Lake,the director's penchant for blending queerness into Hitchcockian genre conventions keeps the story both compelling and enigmatic. In limited theaters starting Friday Killian Maddox (Jonathan Majors) is a bodybuilder who has trouble connecting. Apart from looking after his grandfather and working in a grocery store, he spends every remaining waking hour lifting weights and practicing poses. He also practices smiling — it doesn't come naturally — and he goes at it all with scary intensity. Hopped up on steroids, he threatens hospital nurses, trashes a hardware store, and scares off a cashier he has a crush on by inviting her to dinner, then talking her ear off about delts and grievances while ordering steak, chicken and fish, and keeping the menu because he knows he'll want more. Writer/director Elijah Bynum forefronts Killian's vulnerability in a film that seems headed from the start for a violent explosion. Magazine Dreamspremiered at Sundance in 2023, and Jonathan Majors' performance as Killian generated Oscar buzzbefore his 2023 convictions for misdemeanor assault and harassment of an ex-girlfriend. The film's plans were derailed, as was Majors' career. Still, his committed performance — including oiled musculature reflecting light in rippling patterns — is what will rivet audiences.",2025-03-22 00:36:59

www.npr.org,Review,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5332239/the-alto-knights-review-robert-de-niro,"Justin Chang Robert De Niro plays Frank Costello inThe Alto Knights.Jennifer Rose Clasen/Warner Bros.hide caption It's been 10 years sinceBarry Levinsondirected a new feature, and if that seems like a long wait, I should note that it's taken 50 years forThe Alto Knights, his new movie, to make it to the big screen. The idea was first pitched in the 1970s, not long after the New York City crime lord Frank Costello, known as ""the prime minister of the underworld,"" died at the age of 82. But the film languished in development hell for decades and only got the green light a few years ago, presumably on the strength of a major casting gimmick: Both Costello and his notorious friend-turned-rival, Vito Genovese, are played by the same actor, Robert De Niro. That's one way to liven up the formula, I suppose. De Niro has played many mobsters, inThe Godfather: Part II,The Untouchables,GoodfellasandThe Irishman, for starters.He's riffing on a lot of those characters inThe Alto Knights, which often plays like a hectic rehash of mob-drama clichés. That's notentirelythe movie's fault; the real-life events it's tackling here are why some of those clichés exist. Frank Costello was the inspiration forThe Godfatherhimself, Don Vito Corleone. The Alto Knightsbegins with a bang in 1957: Frank, the big boss of the Luciano crime family, is shot in the lobby of his New York apartment building. Frank survives and knows immediately that it was Vito who ordered the hit, but he keeps this a secret; he isn't interested in revenge, and he doesn't want to start a mob war. From there, the story flashes back about 50 years, recounting in rapid-fire fashion how young Frank and Vito befriended each other in New York, where they hung out at the Alto Knights Social Club, a hive of gangster activity. Both men became bootleggers during Prohibition, rising through the ranks of the Luciano family; Vito became boss, but fled to Italy to avoid a murder rap. By the time Vito returned, years later, after World War II, Frank was in charge of a prosperous criminal empire, protected by paid-off cops and politicians. Most of this backstory passes by in a barely coherent rush, which is a shame. Given his knack for dramas about immigrant experiences and boyhood friendships in films likeDiner,AvalonandLiberty Heights, Levinson could have teased out something rich from Frank and Vito's early years. ButThe Alto Knights, which was written byGoodfellasscreenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, is eager to race ahead to the tug-of-war between De Niro and De Niro. Vito, who's violent and irrationally jealous, wants to seize back control of the outfit and turn it into a drug-dealing operation. Frank is trying to cultivate a legitimate, respectable image and tries to talk Vito out of it. I'm not sure exactly what the movie gains from having one actor play both roles, unless it's trying to suggest that Frank and Vito are two sides of the same corrupt coin. Whatever the case, De Niro is clearly at home with this gangland material, and it's fun to watch him argue with himself. As Vito, De Niro seems to be channeling Joe Pesci's hothead fromGoodfellas, barking and cursing under a layer of prosthetic pancake. As Frank, he smiles, shrugs, and plays it cool. Frank doesn't want any trouble; he just wants to rake in the dough, hobnob with philanthropists and politicians, and spend his nights at home watching TV with his wife, played by a frownyDebra Messing. They have a loving, stable marriage, unlike Vito and his fiery wife, Anna, played by a very good Kathrine Narducci. The Alto Knightsdoesn't have many more ideas than this good-mobster/bad-mobster dynamic. The script does pull together a lot of events from the 1950s, including a Senate investigation into interstate crimes and a historic summit that brought together hundreds of mob bosses from around the country. But the movie doesn't seem to trust its own story. Barely a scene goes by that isn't embellished with popping flashbulbs and giant newspaper headlines, as if Levinson were trying to convince us that we were watching history in the making. Still, De Niro's performances do keep you watching — or, at least, one of them does. Vito may be little more than a walking tantrum, but Frank makes for good company, especially in those moments, toward the end, when he seriously considers bowing to Vito and stepping aside. So what if De Niro is playing a sentimentalized version of a ruthless crook? Hollywood gangster movies — even the ones as dubious and derivative as this one — have always known a thing or two about selling us a beautiful lie.",2025-03-22 00:37:03

His son, 18-year-old Carlos Daniel Terán from Venezuela, had been in immigration detention centers in Texas after being arrested on Jan. 26, andaccused by the U.S. government of being part of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang recently designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. NPR,which first reported about Carlos' arrest last month, could not find any criminal records for him in Texas, or anywhere else across the U.S. On March 15, Juan Terán last spoke to his son. It was via text message. ""Bendición papá,we are being taken out,"" the son wrote. ""With God's help, we are leaving today."" Juan replied, ""God bless you, son."" Since then, Juan Terán has not heard from Carlos. On Wednesday, Juan Terán received a photo that he believes confirms what he had feared — his son was one of the 261 immigrants sent to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, despite afederal judge ordering the flights carrying the men to turn around. Carlos Daniel's case is caught up in a broader brewing battle between executive and judicial authority. Judge JamesBoasberg has repeatedly pressedthe Justice Department for details on those flights to El Salvador over concerns the administration may have defied his orders. ""He looks a lot like my son,"" Juan Terán said of the photo. ""He has big ears — he looks like my son."" Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't reply to NPR's questions about Carlos Daniel's case and his location. Juan Terán said his son thought he was going to be deported back to his native Venezuela. Instead, it seems like he ended up at the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT — a notorious El Salvador prison, which human rights groups have raised concerns about. He worries about his son's well-being. ""He's a child … I know that my son has a weak mind, and I know he feels scared,"" Juan Terán said, choking up. NPR talked to the families of four men believed to be in El Salvador. None of them had a serious criminal record in the U.S. Only one had been charged with illegal entry. Three of the four are believed to have signed their voluntary departure orders, a move that would in theory allow them to come to the U.S. at a later time if approved. Some of the families have been able to either identify their loved ones through official photos or videos released by El Salvador's government. But the U.S. government has not provided a list of names, evidence of crimes or affiliation to Tren de Aragua. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavittwas asked about thisthis week. She said the White House was ""not going to reveal operational details about a counterterrorism operation."" Leavitt said that immigration enforcement agents who investigated the migrants sent to El Salvador ""have great evidence and indication, they have the highest degree of professionalism and they were 100% confident in the individuals that were sent home on these flights."" But the White House has not provided any details or evidence to sustain their claims. A source in the State Department says even within the department the administration is not sharing any evidence that supports the claims that these men are members of Tren de Aragua. The source fears the men will never go to trial and could die in prison, given the harsh conditions and El Salvador's track record. The source requested anonymity fearing retribution and because they are not authorized to speak publicly.

That's why we engaged them on this process."" In a court filing earlier this week related to a challenge to the flights to El Salvador, Justice Department lawyers provided a sworn declaration from an ICE official who said that many of the people on these flights the administration claimed were members of Tren de Aragua, didn't have criminal records in the U.S. ""The lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose,"" the declaration stated. Mercedes Yamarte said she recognized her 24-year-old son Mervin José Yamarte Fernándezin a videofrom the government of El Salvador. ""My biggest surprise is when I saw the video and I saw my son's face,"" she said in Spanish. ""I can't express all the suffering I saw in my son's eyes."" She said her son had been living in Dallas, and was working there. He loved to play soccer, and learn new skills. Yamarte says her son doesn't have a criminal record. He signed deportation papers thinking he was going to Venezuela. ""They don't have to ruin the life of a young man who has never been in prison, has never been a criminal,"" Yamarte said. ""He's always worked hard — I taught him that."" Ivette Borges also believes her cousin was sent to El Salvador. Neri Jose Alvarado Borges, 25, was living in Lewisville, Texas before he ended up at an immigration detention center in Laredo. The last time his family heard from him was last Friday. He told his mom he was going to be deported to Venezuela. Borges says Alvarado's mother is in shock. Alvarado doesn't have a criminal record and they are worried about him. They have not been able to positively identify him since his tattoos are not visible in the photos published by the El Salvador government. ""Today is the first time I have the strength to talk about him,"" Borges says. ""It's maddening to not know anything about him."" For Mirelys Casique Lopez, the thought of seeing his son at the El Salvador prison is too painful. Francisco Javier García Casique.Casique Familyhide caption She says Francisco Javier Garcia, 24, was working as a barber in Longview, Texas. He had signed his deportation order last year but, because Venezuela was not accepting deportees, he was allowed to stay in the country. But early last month, immigration agents showed up in his neighborhood and he was arrested. ""Trump's government said they were going after the worst criminals, so we imagined he was going after someone who had killed people in the U.S.,"" Casique said, adding that her son doesn't have a criminal record in the U.S. or Venezuela. She provided NPR with an official document from Venezuela stating García does not have a criminal record. But the family was somewhat relieved — they really thought Garcia was going to be sent to Venezuela. But a month later, on Saturday, he called his mom to tell her he was about to leave the detention facility in Laredo, Texas. ""I'm going to see the planes, and I know you will be on one of them,"" Cacique told her son. ""Don't you worry, my son — God bless you."" But those airplanes never landed in Venezuela. She later learned flights had landed in El Salvador. Her other kids have identified their brother in social media videos. ""He followed the rules… I feel we were very naive,"" she said. ""We trusted that the U.S. was going to respect his rights — they don't respect human rights."" NPR's Michele Kelemen contributed to this story.",2025-03-22 00:37:28

A federal judge is asking the government for proof that it complied to his order in its deportation of more than 200 alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1789.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption Afederal judgeon Thursday said the government provided a ""woefully insufficient"" response to his prior orders in a case over President Trump's use of wartime powers. Judge James Boasberg had earlier asked the Trump administration to provide more details about weekend flights that deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members and other people to El Salvador — despite his order to turn the planes around. He sought more proof the government was complying with his temporary restraining order. He asked the government to provide details about the flights, or explain why such details fall under ""the state-secrets doctrine."" This privilege would allow the government to refuse to provide evidence that a court requests because doing so could harm U.S. national security or foreign relations. Boasberg initially gave a deadline on Wednesday, and then extended it mid-day on Thursday. ""In an ex parte pleading delivered shortly after today's deadline, the Government again evaded its obligations,"" Boasberg wrote on Thursday. An ex parte pleading means the filings went directly to the judge, without notifying the other parties in the case. He said the government only provided a six-paragraph declaration from a regional official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement that repeated information shared previously, and added that: ""Cabinet Secretaries are currently actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets privilege over the other facts requested by the Court's order. Doing so is a serious matter that requires careful consideration of national security and foreign relations, and it cannot properly be undertaken in just 24 hours."" Boasberg called this response ""woefully insufficient."" ""To begin, the Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege; indeed, his declaration on that point, not surprisingly, is based solely on his unsubstantiated 'understand[ing],'"" he wrote. The judge reset the deadlines in the case and asked the government to explain any discussions regarding invoking state secrets privileges by 10a.m. on Friday, and to decide whether to invoke such privilege by March 25. A spokesperson in a statement said ""The Department of Justice continues to believe that the court's superfluous questioning of sensitive national security information is inappropriate judicial overreach.""

www.npr.org,Perspective,https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2025/03/20/opioid-crisis-and-addiction-martha-bebinger,"Editor's note: A version of this essay originally appeared in WBUR's CommonHealth newsletter. You can subscribe to that newsletterhere. One year ago this month, police found the body of my nephew on the front seat of a borrowed car in a gas station parking lot. Austen Smith was 29. He'd been addicted to pain pills, on and off, for more than 10 years. On some level,Austen knew the risk he was taking in those wee morning hours, but opioids had hijacked his brain. This time there was enough fentanyl in whatever Austen took to kill him. The risk-taking piece is no surprise. Austen always pushed for more out of life. As a tike, he’d be the first into the deep end of the pool or off the diving board or down the water slide — backwards. On hikes Austen went straight up the mountain, if possible. It was Austen who pulled the cousins away from screens for a fishing trip or game of football. In his late teens, Austen started using pain pills to relieve the distress of Crohn’s disease. Sometime in his early 20s he got addicted. In 2018, Austen went into treatment and did not use drugs for several years. He finished law school and worked for several firms, successfully arguing one federal appeals court case. But about a year before he died, my sister told me Austen was using again. Maybe it was to relieve stress — or maybe to cope with that insatiable urge to get more out of each day. I don't know. I didn't ask. Although I knew Austen struggled with addiction — and visited him in treatment — I almost never asked him about his experience of the disease, or his recovery. I asked about Crohn's disease, Austen's other chronic condition, the one that launched his attachment to opioids. ""How's the pain?"" I would ask. ""Are any of the meds helping? How much do they cost? Did you read that study I sent you? What are you doing about your diet?"" Austen loved to share his latest healthy eating tips. I’m a health reporter. I listened, learned some things and occasionally pushed back when Austen claimed he’d found a miracle cure. But I never asked about the disease that killed my dear, dear Austen. Me, the reporter who has written or said the words ""shame kills"" so many times in stories and conversations about addiction. In grief, I’ve found myself asking, why did I let shame get between me and my lovable bundle of energy, curiosity and joy? I wasn't ashamed of Austen — not in any way — I'm sure of that. But I didn't want him to think I was ashamed of him. So, I didn't bring up this condition because other people call it shameful. I did the same thing with Austen's sister and brothers. We talked a little bit about how Austen was doing but not in any depth, because I assumed they would be embarrassed. I didn’t ask my niece or other nephews how they were coping with the stress of Austen’s addiction, if they had any ideas about how I could help — or if they were scared. I gave in to the fear of shame. I will regret this to my last breath. It's stunning that it took the death of someone I love dearly to show me how deeply fear and shame are embedded in the way we treat people with an addiction. I have no idea whether frank, open conversations might have made a difference in Austen's life. What if I'd asked: ""Are you OK? Do you feel safe? What can I do to help?"" Or even: ""Will you please call me if you're ever using alone, so I can call 911 if you stop responding?"" Austen died alone, across the street from a hospital. I am ashamed that I didn't ask Austen these questions. I still collapse sometimes, sobbing, begging Austen, or God, or someone, for another chance. That's irrational, of course, but my heart isn't ready to listen to reason. It's stunning that it took the death of someone I love dearly to show me how deeply fear and shame are embedded in the way we treat people with an addiction. I knew this. And yet I still couldn’t see how shame was controlling my conversations with Austen. The blinders were too big, until it was too late. What I can do now is banish shame. It's useless, dangerous and destructive. I can pledge to Austen that I will never be guided by it again. I wish I could tell Austen. I want to see his face transform with that dimpled smile. He’d be so happy that I am trying to fix my mistakes. In many ways, he was already way ahead of me. Follow Cog onFacebookandInstagram. And sign up for ourweekly newsletter.",2025-03-22 00:37:33
www.npr.org,'It breaks the trust': Florida agencies rush to partner with ICE on deportations,https://www.wlrn.org/government-politics/2025-03-21/florida-ice-police-sheriff-deportation-task-force-trump,"The vast majority of local and state police departments nationwide that have signed written agreements to assist the Trump Administration’s mass deportation agenda on the street level are in Florida. As of Tuesday, 140 law enforcement agencies at the state, county and local levels have signed “task force” agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across the nation, according to an ICE database. A total of 97 of them are in Florida, including the sheriff's office in each of 67 counties. “President Trump promised to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history,” announced Gov. Ron DeSantis at a press conference late last month at the Homestead Air Force Base. “The fact is if the state and locals are not fully participating in those efforts it’s going to be very difficult to achieve that.”  READ MORE:ICE is quietly expanding operations with local law enforcement across the nation  But in the wake of the unprecedented alignment of local, state and federal powers, many residents and experts worry that the closer local officials work with ICE officials, the higher the cost in the community when it comes to the foundational thing that law enforcement relies upon to keep communities safe: trust. “Before the elections, we always had a good relationship with the sheriff’s office. They would always be there for community sporting events and other events and they were always welcome,” an indigenous Guatemalan resident of Lake Worth Beach told WLRN, on the condition that his name not be used to protect his privacy. “But now we’re scared to get close to them.” Last year, the man got his asylum claim approved to remain in the country legally. Even still, knowing that the sheriff’s office plans to work closely with ICE makes many in the community nervous, including himself. “There’s a certain risk that I will be detained,” he told WLRN. Nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the U.S., according to thelatest Homeland Security Department estimates. Florida, with 590,000, has the third highest number of any state in the country. In early February, ICEannouncedthe arrest of 32 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions in Palm Beach County. They were  from Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission assisted federal immigration authorities. In late February, there was an ICE raid conducted in Lake Worth Beach, and at least a dozen people reportedly got rounded up. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told WLRN that his office was not involved with either operation. The office does have anew agreement under the 287(g) program with ICE, he acknowledged, but for now deputies are limited to transporting detainees once they are already under ICE custody. The new agreement that will allow sheriff’s deputies to start asking for papers during regular traffic stops is not in effect yet, because the needed training has not taken place. Bradshaw said ICE agents in the community are mainly looking for people with criminal histories, but that they might do “collateral arrests” in the process, scooping up people with no criminal records. “When you talk about collateral, our entire community has become collateral damage, if they're trying to capture a dozen, two dozen folks who have criminal records,” said Mari Blanco, Assistant Executive Director of the Guatemalan-Maya Center in Lake Worth Beach, a nonprofit serving immigrants. For Blanco, the new partnership with ICE — whether it is currently in effect or not — is already having real world consequences. “PBSO has been working towards creating a relationship with the community for years to be able to properly identify crimes and do their policing. This is going to harm their relationship,” said Blanco. “It takes years to build that trust and seconds to destroy it.” Lake Worth Beach Commissioner Christopher McVoy is pushing for a series of townhall meetings about immigration policy to help maintain trust in community policing as the crackdowns intensify. “The community starts losing confidence in law enforcement if they're not sure where law enforcement falls on all this ICE enforcement,” he said. “We need law enforcement in our city. It's a big deal.” Florida's history Florida was actually the first state to adopt a program that let local and state police interrogate and detain people suspected of being in the U.S. unlawfully, back in 2002 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. The thinking back then was that local and federal agencies needed to work together to combat international terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Floridajumped on the programearly because a majority of the Saudi pilots werefound to have done flight trainingin Miami-Dade and Broward counties. This month, President Trump announced he is invoking wartime powers to combat what he says is an “invasion” of unlawful immigration to the country. “This is a time of war,” the presidentdeclared, even though Congress has not declared any war. In the years following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Aarti Kohli closely studied the intersection of local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, when she was a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Her studies found that trust fell as local and federal authorities integrated on enforcement efforts. “Witnesses wouldn’t come forward, or victims of crime wouldn’t come forward. It really eroded trust in local communities and it increased racial profiling,” Kohli told WLRN. The issue with racial profiling became most prominent in Maricopa County, Arizona, where then Sheriff Joe Arpaio used new powers granted to him by ICE to conduct broad raids on Latino communities more than a decade ago. The Justice Department found widespread and documented evidence of racial profiling, with U.S. citizens being caught in the dragnet simply because of how they looked or sounded. Notably, the DOJ also found crime rose when local police carried out enforcement of immigration laws. “From 2004 to the end of 2007, reported violent crimes grew by over 69 percent, including a 166 percent increase in homicides over the three-year period,” found a 2011 DOJ report. “It was all aboutCommunity Oriented Policingin the past. That’s what the DOJ wanted to resource. These 287(g) agreements gut that,” said Kohli. “These programs are just counter to the whole notion of Community Oriented Policing, because the whole notion of that is trust.” Pushback from residents in some communities In Coral Gables, the city police department entered into an agreement with ICE without any public input, prompting pushback from residents and activists. Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak, who is also the legislative chair for the Florida Association of Police Chiefs, defended his decision to partner with ICEduring an interview Sundayon Local 10's This Week In South Florida. ""This does not make us the ICE agents that are actively going to be looking for individuals,"" Hudak said. Alana Greer, an attorney at the Community Justice Project, said city police should have no role in civil immigration enforcement. ""It breaks the trust between our residents, it diverts our resources and our taxpayer dollars and it harms our neighbors, our friends and our community,” Greer said. By contrast, the City of Hialeah held a meeting about whether it should enter into one of these agreements. Facing pushback from residents who said working with ICE would hurt community trust, Hialeah Mayor Esteban Bovo said it was nothing to worry about. “Many might wanna go and put fear mongering out there so everyone gets nervous, but tomorrow morning it will be business as usual in the city of Hialeah,” said Bovo. Cities, large and small, across Florida have recently penned agreements with ICE, ranging from Panama City and Key West, to Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Davie and Naples. Three members of the city council in Fort Myers voted against entering into a 287(g) agreement with ICE, bogging down the decision in a tie. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that he wouldinvestigate the council membersover their votes. By state law, police agencies are only explicitly required to enter into 287(g) agreements if they operate a county jail. In January, DeSantisproposed a lawthat all agencies with 25 or more officers would be required to enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE, but that provision was stripped from a billthat became lawin February after lawmakers pushed back on it. In a letter sent to Fort Myers commissioners,  Attorney General Uthmeier alleged that the commissioners are breaking 2019anti-sanctuary city law. That law was passed six years before the current 287(g) task force model even existed, but the office is interpreting that law extremely broadly, suggesting any city that does not enter into an agreement with ICE is breaking Florida law. Over 300 municipalities have not done so, the vast majority of cities. ""By failing to approve the Department's 287(g) agreement, Fort Myers is implicitly implementing a sanctuary policy,"" Uthmeier wrote in the letter. ""Prohibiting city police officers from receiving the necessary federal training to adequately enforce U.S. immigration laws not only prevents city police from enforcing current federal immigration law but effectively prevents the city police department from participating in federal immigration operations."" DeSantis was more blunt. ""Govern yourselves accordingly,"" he  posted Tuesday on X above a news story on the commission's actions. Thanks to the laws we’ve recently enacted in Florida, local entities are required to participate in federal immigration enforcement.The 287 (g) program trains local law enforcement to aid ICE. Florida will ensure its laws are followed, and when it comes to immigration—the days…https://t.co/drS0JI8FVR One thing is clear, whatever the law might require: dozens of Florida agencies are entering into agreements with ICE, marking a major shift following 9/11. In 2004, David Harris, a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh, testified before Congress about the use of local police to help immigration enforcement. He told WLRN that congressional leaders were perplexed about why more local police did not assist ICE at the height of the Global War on Terror, and that they were surprised at what police had to say about it at the time. “I had with me eleven pages of quotations from police chiefs, police union leaders, sheriffs, all kinds of people — just saying no. Bad idea. Not good for our communities’ safety, and that’s our priority,” Harris told WLRN about the 2004 congressional hearing. What most surprises Harris is that it is not just statewide law enforcement agencies or countywide sheriff’s offices that have agreed to partner with ICE, but small, medium and large cities as well. “Obviously the political climate has changed, and the social climate has changed,” said Harris. “The cities that do this — if they have any immigrant population at all, and if as is typical the household are mixed as to status — they will pay a price for this that they may not want to recognize.”",2025-03-22 00:37:37

www.foxnews.com,Judge rages at Trump admin for making move ‘in the dark’: ‘Did you not understand?’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-fumes-over-late-night-deportation-move-signed-in-dark,"Retired ICE field officer John Fabbricatore joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's legal battle over deportation flights and the search for two migrant escapees in Colorado. A federal judgegrilled Trump administration lawyersFriday over the deportation of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador despite an earlier court order explicitly blocking the move. It was the latest in a legal dispute that could reach the Supreme Court. During a motion hearing, U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg questioned Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign about why the Trump administrationfailed to complywith an emergency court order that temporarily blocked its use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua, from U.S. soil for 14 days. At least 261 migrants were deported Saturday from the U.S. to El Salvador, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal ""solely on the basis"" of the law temporarily blocked by the court. Boasberg used the first portion of Friday's hearing to press Ensign for details over the government's deportation flights to El Salvador. 'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg(Getty) ""Why was this proclamation signed in the dark on Friday, early Saturday morning, and then these people rushed onto the planes?"" Boasberg askedJustice Departmentattorneys. ""To me, the only reason to do that is if you know the problem, and you want to get them out of the country before a suit is filed."" Ensign was also pressed at length over what he knew about the deportations during last week's court hearing, when Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to temporarily halt any planned removals of Venezuelan migrants subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg also issued a bench ruling Saturday ordering the immediate return of any planes deporting the Venezuelan nationals targeted for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA ""Can I ask you now how you interpreted that statement when we had a conversation on Saturday?"" he asked Ensign. ""Did you not understand my statement during that hearing? ""You told me you had no details on the plane flights. Then we held a recess for 38 minutes for you to find details,"" the judge reminded Ensign. ""And then when you came back — and even though the flights were in the air — you represented that you had no details of the flights?"" ""That's correct,"" Ensign responded, telling the judge no one would give him the information he sought about the deportation flights. ""I did not know they were in the air."" Former President Donald Trump’s personal attorneys, Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and John Lauro, depart federal court in Washington, D.C., in 2024.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Boasberg has ordered Trump administration officials to explain by Tuesday why they failed to comply with his order requiring the deportation flights to return and whether they knowingly defied his ruling. Though the judge acknowledged the Trump administration has ""wide latitude"" to enforce immigration law, he has repeatedly expressed frustration with the government and its failure to answer major questions about the flights. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? He reiterated these concerns Friday and raised new concerns about the administration's apparent defiance of federal judges. ""The hypotheticals are frightening,"" Boasberg told Ensign. ""If the courts can’t review"" the administration's use of the wartime-era deportation law, ""then the president could say anyone is invading. If some foreign fisherman comes into U.S. waters, the president could say that’s an invasion. ""Even you would say that's alarming."" ""That's up to Congress,"" Ensign responded. President Donald Trump arrives with Attorney General Pam Bondi to speak at the Justice Department in Washington, March 14, 2025.(Pool via AP) In a court order filed Thursday, Boasberg castigated lawyers for the Justice Department forfailing to answer his questionsabout the deportation flights, even after he let them do so under seal, noting that the government had ""again evaded its obligations."" It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will invoke the state secrets privilege in the court battle, which could allow it to withhold certain information for national security purposes. In a court declaration filed Friday morning, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Boasberg he is aware of Cabinet-level discussions invoking that privilege. The administration could present that argument at an appellate court hearing next week. Invoking that privilege ""is a serious matter that requires careful consideration of national security and foreign relations, and it cannot properly be taken in just 24 hours,"" Blanche told the court Friday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP PresidentDonald Trump,for his part, demanded in a social media post Friday that the Supreme Court move to rein in federal judges who have blocked over 300 of his executive orders and actions. In a Truth Social post, Trump implored the Supreme Court to ""STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."" ""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!"" he added.

After nationwide incidents targeting Tesla electric vehicles, dealerships, storage lots and charging stations,the FBIon Friday warned the public to ""exercise vigilance"" near the company's properties. Since January 2025, Tesla electric vehicles have been targeted in at least nine states, according to the FBI. The incidents involved arson, gunfire and vandalism, including graffiti expressing grievances against those the perpetrators perceive to be racists, fascists orpolitical opponents, the FBI said. The attacks, which some are calling domestic terrorism, come after the company's CEO, Elon Musk, was appointed byPresident Donald Trumpto lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Fox News Digital previously reported several Teslas in Las Vegas were set on fire with Molotov cocktails, an Oregon Tesla dealership was shot up, a second Oregon Tesla dealership was damaged by incendiary devices and several Tesla charging stations were set on fire in Massachusetts. TESLA ARSONS PROBED AS 'DOMESTIC TERRORISM' CHEERED BY 'ANTI-CAPITALIST' GROUP LINKED TO 2020 RIOTS Those responsible for the criminal acts against Tesla appear to be ""lone offenders"" who target the properties at night, according to the FBI. ""Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes,"" the FBI said. Hundreds of people protest outside a Tesla showroom in New York City.(Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) The agency urged the public to ""exercise vigilance"" for suspicious activity in areas occupied by Tesla dealerships or Tesla-related entities. It noted criminals could make threats online, inquire about or examine security measures at Tesla dealerships, take photos of security-related equipment or personnel at Tesla dealerships or attempt to gain access to restricted areas at Tesla-related properties by bypassing security. This week, a website called ""Dogequest"" claimed to havecompiled a listof Tesla owners, their addresses, phone numbers and email addresses in an apparent effort to dox those who have not sold their vehicles out of fear of being targeted.

(Roger Lyon/LOCAL NEWS X /TMX) A smallGeorgia vacation spotand organizers of a historically rowdy festival called Orange Crush are coming together to try to make the event safer and more organized this spring. Orange Crush, a spring break event in Tybee Island, Georgia, that used to be organized by students at nearbySavannah State University, brought ""complete mayhem"" to Tybee Island in 2023, according to Mayor Brian West, but he is optimistic for a better event this year. West hosted a town hall on Friday, March 21, to discuss community concerns about the event, which will take place in Tybee on Saturday, April 19, and opened the discussion with a brief history of Orange Crush. West explained how it began as a relatively small spring break gathering in 1989 but has since grown into a large festival that local officials have struggled to control in recent years. West previously explained to Fox News Digital that Orange Crush in years past was ""riotous"" with ""stampeding"" and gunfire in the city's parking lots. Trash is seen along the beach as spring breakers party near the pier on April 20, 2024, during Orange Crush in Tybee Island, Ga.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) On Friday, West shared the town's extensive plans to coordinate traffic, parking and safety for both event-goers and locals on the weekend of April 19. Orange Crush organizers Steven Smalls and George Turner approached West in December to apply for the event's first-ever permit from Tybee Island. On Jan. 29, Tybee Island issued a conditional letter of approval, and local officials have been meeting with organizers to discuss plans since then. CRIME ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES SPIKES AFTER DECADE OF STEADY DECLINE AS STUDENTS FEAR FOR SAFETY On Thursday, Tybee Island granted a special permit for Orange Crush after negotiating a one-day event rather than a three-day event, as well as an agreed-upon site plan, which blocks access to Tybee Island parking lots, where West said some nefarious activity occurred at past Orange Crush events. Attendees can also rent beach equipment and there will be special VIP areas this year, West said. Additionally, Tybee Island will be bringing in extra police officers to help enforce public safety.

""We are taking this event very seriously."" ""We want to make sure the culture and the cleanliness of the beach is maintained post-event,"" Waters said, adding that there will be a private cleanup after the event so that locals can attend a clean Easter event on the Sunday afterward. ""We want to, in our welcome center, make sure that they know how important this island is and how important this city is. We want them to know the history. We are taking a full day to educate them,"" Waters said, adding that they will enforce the one-day event. ""We are going to have a rapid cleanup."" A police officer is shown as law enforcement conducts traffic safety checks on April 19, 2024, in Tybee Island, Ga.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) Turner and Smalls spoke afterward, similarly assuring locals that the event could be clean, safe and well-organized. Smalls expressed optimism at working with city leaders to organize the first ""official"" Orange Crush in Tybee Island this spring. While the event is no longer affiliated with Savannah State, it is returning to Tybee Island on Easter weekend and expected to draw an estimated 50,000 attendees to the three-mile-long island. ORANGE CRUSH 2025: POPULAR GEORGIA BEACH TOWN APPROVES RETURN OF CRIME-FILLED BEACH FEST Since the event's inception in 1989, promoters have taken over the planning process with the goal of getting more attendees and more money, which hastransformed Orange Crushinto a wild weekend for the typically quiet beach town, according to West. Workers set up barricades to block street parking and side streets along Butler Avenue on April 16, 2024, as Tybee Island prepares for Orange Crush.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) Locals have previously complained of litter, traffic issues and violence as a result of the party and the masses of people it draws to Tybee Island. In parking lots after sundown, attendees get on top of police cars and engage in violent behavior like throwing glass bottles. Local leaders and law enforcement have been working to contain those issues to keep residents and Orange Crush participants as safe as possible. ""It was complete mayhem."" ""One of our officers was hit in the head with a bottle. It was complete mayhem. So, we had to close our parking lots so they're not available for use,"" the mayor explained previously told Fox News Digital the 2023 Orange Crush. ROAD RAGE SHOOTING CAPS GEORGIA '23 SPRING BREAK CHAOS AT TYBEE ISLAND West previously expressed concern with approving the permit due to promoters that have given the city issues during past Orange Crush events. Spring breakers dance during Orange Crush.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) Smalls previously told Fox News Digital in a statement that his team has ""implemented a structured system to bring organization, security, and entertainment to this event — something that has never been done before."" ""I have worked closely with Tybee Island officials, including Mayor Brian West, law enforcement in Tybee Island and Savannah, and other key stakeholders, to develop a rigorous plan for this year’s festival,"" Smalls said. ""Our team has followed a strict schedule to ensure that every detail is carefully organized and executed with safety and structure in mind."" Smalls noted that Orange Crush has ""been a longstanding tradition, occurring with or without a permit,"" but this year will be different because ""for the first time, the event is officially structured, with security, waste management, and traffic coordination in place."" Tybee Island rents out a pier on a state-owned beach to provide security during Orange Crush.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) ""While we cannot control every outside promoter who associates themselves with the event, we are the official organizers and have taken the necessary steps to bring accountability and order to the festival,"" he continued. ""If the City of Tybee Island is concerned about certain individuals, we encourage them to apply consistent enforcement across all local businesses that choose to work with outside promoters during this weekend."" POLICE, GUNMAN EXCHANGE FIRE IN HOTEL AFTER PHONY 'MURDER' CONFESSION, BODYCAM SHOWS Smalls asked ""the public to not rush to judgment but instead allow this newly organized Orange Crush Festival the opportunity to demonstrate the positive changes we’ve made."" ""This is a new era for the event, and for the first time, there is a clear plan of action to ensure it is structured and well-managed,"" he said. Orange Crush attendees at past events have littered parts of Tybee Island's beach with trash in the sand and in the water.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) At past events, festival promoters have formed circles packed with people on the beach or in parking lots where attendees have to pay to see what is happening inside the circle, which could be anything from two men fighting to people having sex to naked women dancing. POPULAR GEORGIA BEACH TOWN OVERRUN BY ‘ORANGE CRUSH’ FIGHTING, CHAOS, VIDEO SHOWS ""If an officer tries to go and control that situation, all of the sudden, they're surrounded by 5,000 people,"" West said. ""Even if they tried to arrest someone, our jail is an hour away in Savannah, so that means taking an officer off their job and away from where we need them, so the best thing they can do is try to keep the crowd in their space."" Tybee Island has a one-lane road that leads to the island from Savannah, and with the event drawing tens of thousands of people, it leads to traffic chaos, including cars that end up on neighboring islands because they can't make it to Tybee Island. ""It's very uncomfortable for the people who live in this area,"" West said. ""People actually drive through other people's yards. It can get really out of hand."" Tybee Island Mayor Brian West said volunteers clean up after Orange Crush for about a week after the event.(Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA TODAY NETWORK) The city has tried to control traffic by fencing off neighborhood backstreets, closing certain parking lots and assigning personnel to direct cars.Tybee Island leadersclosed parking lots in 2024 and plan to do so in 2025 as well. The city also rents out a pier on the beach so that law enforcement can use it during the event. The Tybee Island Police Department typically has about 30 officers covering an area of about 3,200 homes, so the city is bringing in other state and local officers during Orange Crush weekend, West said. There are about 100 to 150 officers expected for the festival in April. Orange Crush attendees at past events have also littered parts of Tybee Island's beach with trash in the sand and in the water. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Back in 2018, Tybee Island implemented new regulations cracking down on Orange Crush weekend, including restrictions on open alcohol, as Tybee is an open container city; increased traffic stops and property searches; and limits on home rentals. An activist group called the Concerned Citizens of Tybee complained about the regulations and involved the Justice Department. Eventually, the group and city leaders came to a mediation in July 2018. The agreement states that Tybee will apply the same rules and restrictions to all large events on the island, ""permitted or unpermitted,"" that will be applied equally.

When Klein and Shor reviewed numerous charts, including one headlined, ""2024 Democratic Support by Age – Split by Race and Gender,"" the pollster explained that in this chart in particular, ""One thing you can notice is that among 18-year-olds, women of color are the only of the four [race and gender demographic groups] that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men."" The Times columnist seized on one ""shocking"" finding in the data that defies one of the Democratic Party’s core beliefs. NYT columnist Ezra Klein marveled at how old assumptions of the Democratic Party about the youth vote saving them have been utterly dashed by the recent election. JOURNALIST TELLS CNN THE DEMOCRATS' ADVANTAGE WITH YOUNG MEN IS ‘COMPLETELY GONE’ ""I find this part of this chart shocking. I sometimes talk about narrative violations, and if we knew anything aboutDonald Trumpeight years ago, it was that young people didn’t like him. And Republicans had been maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors,"" Klein said. ""But if you look at this chart, 75-year-old White men supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than 20-year-old White men."" ""It is a real shift,"" Shor agreed. ""This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years — that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers, and maybe even in some ways more so, to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years."" The data expert went on to discuss what he called ""the scariest chart in this entire presentation,"" which shows the massive and historically unusual polarization between young men and women. ""What’s crazy is that if you look at people under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. Eighteen-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics,"" Shor said. Ezra Klein and David Shor focused on how young White men were exponentially far less likely to have supported Kamala Harris in the election than 75-year-old White men did, emphasized in the graphic by vertical yellow bars. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE While he argued it is still too early to explain exactly why, Shor observed there are similar patterns in countries like Canada, the U.K., and Norway. ""There’s a lot of research to do here, but it’s still very striking,"" Shor said. ""It’s similar to how a lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem — and it’s still somehow underrated, because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think."" Klein noted numerous factors at play in recent years, ranging from the #MeToo movement and the rise ofthe Manosphere,to how ""there’s a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more a pro-women party and in some ways, sort of anti-young men. And that, in turn, had a huge effect on young men’s political opinions."" Shor responded by stressing again that ""this seems to be a global phenomenon,"" saying he seeks to focus on the ""broader cultural shifts."" After discussing a theory that part of the polarization may be driven by how men and women are interacting with wildly different content on social media, Klein spoke again about how Democratic narratives about an ascendant majority from younger generations have fallen apart. Trump's appearances on numerous podcasts that are popular with young men have been credited as a major reason why he won their support and thus the election.(Impaulsive YouTube channel) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. I do think that, even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority became a little discredited in 2016 and 2020, Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them,"" he said. ""They thought that this was a last gasp of something and that if Donald Trump couldn’t run up his numbers among seniors and you had Millennials and Gen Z really coming into voting power, that would be the end of this Republican Party. That is just completely false, and it might be the beginning of thisRepublican Party,"" Klein added. ""I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago, and it seems I was wrong,"" Shor replied. ""The future has a way of surprising us.""

I swear, this chick never runs out of dumb things to say. It's amazing, really. Borderline impressive. Actually, not borderline at all. Just … impressive. Super impressive. To be this stupid on a daily basis takes a focused determination I'd wager most of us lack. But not Joy. She recently got fired from her MSNBC show that14 people watched,but do you think that stopped her from being a moron? Think that made her take a step back and look in the mirror? Do some soul-searching? Talk to God? Nope to all of that! Not even close. Instead, she joined equally-dumb Don Lemon on whatever hell podcast he hosts nowadays, and predicted that should America and Canada go to war – something that will just never happen – it would be Canada that comes out on top. Canada! Dummy Joy Reid thinks WE would lose a war … to Canada! You see? This is why Trump nuked the Department of Education yesterday. Right here. Joy Reid and Don Lemon are products of that awful institution. This is what they pumped out. No wonder Trump axed it. Talk about a waste of taxpayer money! Anyway, the War of 1812, for those wondering, was fought between the United States and Great Britain over British violations of U.S. maritime rights. It ended in a draw, according to my sources (Google), and something called the Treaty of Ghent reflected this on Christmas Eve, 1814. Also, it's commonly known as one of the most pointless wars ever and a war that nobody actually won. There. Saved y'all hours of scrolling this morning. Less war-talk, more March Madness! As for how a war with Canada would go today, I know David Hookstead is our war expert, but I feel pretty safe in saying that we'd most likely obliterate Canada before dinner on Day 1. I did reach out to him to ask, and he told me the war would be over before my third cup of coffee in the morning. So, take that for what it's worth. Here's a handy-dandy chart on the way out for those who think I'm being a homer: Yeah, I mean, it would be a bloodbath. Again, it won't happen, and it's silly to even entertain the idea. But, this is what happens when you put two of the biggest idiots in the world in the same room for an extended period of time. Congrats everyone, we're all infinitely dumber now!

He lost an election,"" Trump said Friday in the Oval Office of the White House. ""He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part. They say. I think Tim played a part.

""How do you fight it? I think I could kick most of their a--. I do think that,"" Walz said in response. ""But I don’t know if we’re going to fall into that place where we want to— okay, we challenge you to a WWE fight here type thing.""

www.foxnews.com,Gene Hackman and wife Betsy's death investigation bodycam footage released: report,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gene-hackman-wife-betsys-death-investigation-bodycam-footage-released-report,"Stephen Marshall, a retired FBI agent who knew Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa Hackman, recalled the actor being uncomfortable with aging. Bodycam footage ofGene Hackmanand wife Betsy Arakawa Hackman's death investigation has been released, according to reports. TMZ obtained two videosfrom the investigation. One video showed a Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputy talking on the phone with Gene's daughter about what to do with the remains of a dead dog found inside the home near Betsy's body. In the video, Gene's daughter, who TMZ identified as Elizabeth, told the officer to cremate the dead dog and bury her remains with Arakawa. Gene's daughter asked the officer if the dog was the ""older"" one of the couple's bunch. It was later confirmed the dead dog was Zinna, who was 12. She was the couple's oldest dog. Elizabeth asked the officer if Zinna was wearing a collar and, if she was, if he could save it. Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa Hackman's death investigation body camera footage has been released.(Getty Images) The video is dated Feb. 27, the day after Gene and Betsy's bodies were found. GENE HACKMAN DEATH: COMPLETE COVERAGE The second video obtained by TMZ showed a groundskeeper on the day the couple was found, seemingly distraught over their deaths. ""To see that, both of them … I'm sorry,"" the man said while getting emotional. ""I get attached to all these people. They treat me really well. And I met her [Arakawa]. She was a sweetheart and to see them like that…"" ""I get attached to all these people. They treat me really well. And I met her [Betsy]. She was a sweetheart and to see them like that …"" Also in the bodycam footage is an officer sharing that he contacted both of Gene's daughters, Elizabeth and Leslie, after their bodies were discovered. Local news station KOB4reported it had received over an hour of footage from the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department of all the responding officer's bodycams. The outlet reported that most of the videos are from outside the Hackmans' home and interviewed the workers who found them. Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa Hackman were discovered dead in their Santa Fe home Feb. 26.(Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) The outlet noted a recent lawsuit by the Hackman estateattempting to block the releaseof bodycam footage. ""The Sheriff's office says that these fall outside of that scope of that lawsuit from the Hackman estate,"" the outlet noted. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department. Lawyer Kurt Sommer filed a petition March 11 in state district court in Santa Fe attempting to prevent the medical investigator and the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office from releasing footage, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. Betsy likely died a week before Gene Hackman.(Getty Images) The petition attempts to block the release of the couple's autopsy and ""death investigation"" until their deaths can be litigated, according to the outlet. Sommer wrote that once the images are released ""the bell cannot be unrung."" Sommer argued the couple's right to privacy outweighs the public interest in the couple's death. He cited Kurt Cobain's death in his petition and pointed out that a court refused to release the ""death-scene"" photographs. ""Undersigned counsel cannot think of respective harm that would come to the State and County offices from respecting the discretion of Mr. Hackman's and Mrs. Hackman-Arakawa's right to privacy,"" he wrote. Gene Hackman's brain showed ""advanced Alzheimer's disease"" at the time of his death.(Media Home Entertainment/Everett Collection) ""During their lifetime, the Hackmans placed significant value on their privacy and took affirmative, vigilant steps to safeguard their privacy. ""Mr. and Mrs. Hackman were members of this community, not part-time casual residents. The Personal Representative seeks to continue to preserve the privacy of the Hackmans following their tragic death and support the family's constitutional right to remembrance and desire to grieve in peace."" At the time, Sommer had no comment for Fox News Digital. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Gene and Betsy's estate is represented by Julia Peters, a partner and chief counsel for the Avalon Trust Co. investment firm.

According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, Betsy was Gene's first choice, and his second choice, was attorney Michael G. Sutin. Sutin died in 2019. The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department confirmed during a press conference that Betsy likely died Feb. 11, and Gene most likely died one week later. Authorities later stated that officials had determined multiple calls were made Feb. 12 from Betsy to a medical center. Betsy died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, New Mexico officials told reporters. Gene died from hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributing factor.

Smith calling out the Trump administration for the temporary disappearance of baseball legend Jackie Robinson from the Pentagon’s website on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ MLB has removed ""diversity"" references from its careers page amid President Donald Trump's recent executive orders aimed atrolling back DEIinitiatives. A recent Trump executive order includes directives for federal agencies to combat DEI in the private sector, and MLB has taken a step to comply. The independentwebsite cupofcoffeenews.comwas the first outlet to report the removal of MLB's ""diversity"" references Friday. MLB addressed the removal of its ""diversity"" references in a statement Friday. ""Our values on diversity remain unchanged,"" MLB said. ""We are in the process of evaluating our programs for any modifications to eligibility criteria that are needed to ensure our programs are compliant with federal law as they continue forward."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM However, the MLB careers page still includes a reference to inclusion and images of gay pride flags. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred launched a Diversity Pipeline Program in 2016, which resulted in over 400 assisted hires.

TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS? The complaint claimed MLB’s official website presents at least four unlawful employment and contracting programs, citing the MLB Diversity Pipeline Program, the Diversity Fellowship Program, the Diversity in Ticket Sales Training Program and the Diverse Business Partners Program. After an owners meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, last month, Manfred announced MLB was evaluating the interpretation of federal law. ""Our values, particularly our values on diversity, remain unchanged. But another value that is pretty important to us is we always try to comply with what the law is,"" Manfred said. ""There seems to be an evolution going on here. We’re following that very carefully. ""Obviously, when things get a little more settled, we’ll examine each of our programs and make sure that while the values remain the same that we’re also consistent with what the law requires."" The General Services Administration (GSA)announced changes in Februaryto the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) meant to align with the president's executive order aimed at restoring meritocracy and ending discrimination in the public and private sectors. The move reverses previous Biden administration executive orders that made it mandatory to consider DEI when reviewing contract proposals.

Language associated withDEI principleswas also ordered removed from any federal acquisition, contracting, grant or financial assistance procedures.

www.foxnews.com,Federal judge blocks ‘abolish ICE’ activist and illegal immigrant from being deported,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-blocks-abolish-ice-activist-illegal-immigrant-from-being-deported,"‘Border czar’ Tom Homan addresses the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown on ‘Hannity.’ A federal judge in Colorado issued an order Friday blocking immigration officials from deporting ""abolish ICE"" activist and illegal immigrantJeanette Vizguerrabefore a hearing scheduled for next week. The order places a temporary injunction on local ICE officials Johnny Choate and Ernesto Santacruz, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from ordering Vizguerra’s removal while her case is being considered by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Vizguerra, 53, is a Mexican national illegally present in the country for years. After a deportation order was issued against her, Vizguerra voluntarily left the country in 2012, only to illegally return a year later. While in the U.S., Vizguerra has become an outspoken advocate for abolishing ICE and reformingimmigration lawsto be more permissive. DEMOCRAT MAYOR BLASTED FOR VOWING TO MAKE MAJOR CITY ‘SAFE HAVEN’ FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS A federal judge in Colorado issued an order Friday blocking immigration officials from deporting ""abolish ICE"" activist and illegal immigrant Jeanette Vizguerra before her hearing, which is scheduled for next week.(Getty Images) She was arrested by ICE in Aurora, Colorado, Monday, a move that created national controversy with many Democrats and media outlets rushing to her defense. Denver MayorMike Johnstonwas among those who denounced Vizguerra’s arrest, saying, ""This is not immigration enforcement. This is Soviet-style political persecution of political dissidents under the guise of immigration enforcement."" BUCKING BIG-CITY TREND: MAJOR TEXAS CITIES NOW ALERTING ICE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ENCOUNTERS Friday’s order, issued by U.S. District Judge Nina Wang, said, ""In light of these unusual circumstances, this Court respectfully concludes that an injunction is necessary to preserve the status quo and permit this Court the opportunity to thoughtfully consider the issues raised by both sides."" The order states that government officials ""shall not remove"" Vizguerra until the court or the 10th Circuit vacates the order. Though the order claims Vizguerra’s case ""raises complex issues,"" Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and policy expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital the case is simple. Jeanette Vizguerra, who is in the U.S. illegally, holds her son Santiago May 12, 2017, in Denver, Colo.(Getty Images) ""This is a woman who unlawfully entered the United States twice. … She is subject to removal from the United States, and she is removable,"" said Arthur. ""Simply because she has spoken out against the immigration policies in the United States doesn't render her immune from removal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE ""It's almost like a person who robbed the bank, goes to jail, robs another bank and then complains about the penal system in the United States,"" he said. ""Simply because you have thoughts about incarceration rates in this country doesn't mean that you're not still going to be subject to some sort of response because of your subsequent unlawful activity."" Matt O’Brien, director of investigations at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, a watchdog group opposed to abuses against immigration law, told Fox News Digital that, despite the uproar, he believes Vizguerra’s arrest is ""100% justified."" BLUE SANCTUARY STATE OPERATING AS 'CONTROL' CENTER FOR VICIOUS MIGRANT GANG: ACTING DEA CHIEF Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo.(RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images) He said ""the only reason"" Vizguerra evaded arrest for so long was ""because the State of Colorado and the Biden administration were complicit in helping her to remain in the United States through their application of misguided policies that encouraged more lawless behavior and left Americans less safe and secure."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep.Gabe Evans, R-Colo., a freshman congressman whose district includes portions of north Denver, also commented on Vizguerra’s case, telling Fox News Digital it proves Colorado Democrats are not sincere about wanting to help deport criminal aliens. Evans said Colorado Democrats ""always say they want to work with the federal government to remove criminal illegal immigrants and that they’ll honor court orders signed by federal judges. Jeanette Vizguerra qualifies for both these categories, and yet Democrats are still opposed to her arrest, proving that Colorado is run by sanctuary state apologists who can’t even follow their own statements.""

Mike Lawler. EXCLUSIVE: A disruption over the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts turned physical after protesters crashed an event in a red New York district, prompting a Republican lawmaker to raise concerns over Democratic efforts to ""organize protests"" inGOP districts. Protesters disrupted a private luncheon hosted by the Rockland Business Association on Thursday, targeting one of the speakers, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., over Republican efforts to cut federal spending. A video obtained by Fox News Digital shows the protesters, who had bought tickets to the event, screaming, ""Lawless Lawler"" while holding up a sign that read, ""Elon's Puppet"" in an apparent reference to cost-cutting efforts by theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE). The disruption quickly turned physical as the protesters wrestled with the event attendees, who were trying to put an end to the disruption. Lawler's team, responding to the protest, pointed to comments by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., where he said that Democrats were sending people to Republican districts to oppose their policies and make them ""face the consequences.""

""Yesterday, he appeared on PBS and declared: 'We are mobilizing in NY.

Teachers union boss Randi Weingarten says she is concerned that shutting down theDepartment of Educationcould be as harmful to students as the school closures were during COVID. On Thursday,President Donald Trumpsigned an executive order instructing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin the process of shuttering the department. The executive orderasked McMahonto ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely."" ""You know, you can eviscerate a department by laying off its people, by shutting down a web service or online service,"" Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), said Friday on Bloomberg’s ""Balance of Power."" DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SIGNIFICANTLY DISMANTLED IN NEW TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order to reduce the size and scope of the Education Department alongside school children signing their own versions, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.( (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)) ""And so, what I don’t want is, I don’t want it so shut down in so many ways that kids are really hurt. And then somebody says, ‘Oops, we didn’t mean to do that.’ Kids go through kindergarten once,"" Weingarten added. ""We already saw during COVID the longstanding problems that happened when schools were shut down too long. We got to make sure we get this right for kids."" Weingarten, AFT and other teachers' unions have been criticized for years for their reactions to the coronavirus pandemic and reluctance to reopen schools. In July 2020, Weingarten slammed the Trump administration’s guidelines to reopen schools by fall 2020 as ""reckless,"" ""callous"" and ""cruel."" She later called on Congress for more federal funding for schools and threatened a strike if they reopened without implementing expansive safety precautions like mask mandates, 6-foot social distancing requirements (up from the CDC’s recommended 3-foot distance at the time), and updated ventilation systems. Emails from February 2021showed AFT had successfully lobbied the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention to be more cautious in its guidelines for school openings.

""Today’s NAEP results reveal a heartbreaking reality for American students and confirm our worst fears: not only did most students not recover from pandemic-related learning loss, but those students who were the most behind and needed the most support have fallen even further behind,"" the Education Department said in a statement. ""Despite the billions of dollars that the federal government invests in K-12 education annually, and the approximately $190 billion in federal pandemic funds, our education system continues to fail students across the nation.""

www.foxnews.com,Trump turns question on reporter who challenged admin’s authority,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-flips-script-reporter-questioning-admins-authority-deport-illegals,"Principal Deputy DEA Administrator Rob Murphy joins 'America Reports' to discuss Tren de Aragua's command being located in Colorado and how the DEA is cracking down on the organization. President Donald Trumpon Friday pushed back against a reporter's question in the Oval Office by asking whether former President Joe Biden had the legal standing to allow a high number of migrants into the United States during the previous administration. The Trump administration continues in its efforts towardmass deportations, including with recent Immigration and Customs and Enforcement raids, and migrant crossings plummeted in February to their lowest tracked level in decades. ""Do you think you have the authority, the power to round up people, deport them and then you're under no obligation to a court to show the evidence against them?"" a reporter asked the president. PUERTO RICO NO LONGER SAFE BET FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AS TRUMP CRACKDOWN EXPANDS TO US TERRITORY President Donald Trump speaks with U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott, right, as they participate in a ceremony commemorating the 200th mile of border wall at the international border with Mexico in San Luis, Arizona, June 23, 2020.(Saul Loeb/AFP ) ""That's what the law says, and that's what our country needs because … unfortunately, they allowed millions of people to come into our country. Totally unvetted, totally unchecked,"" Trump said, referring to the Biden administration. ""So you ought to ask, 'Did he have the authority to allow millions of people?' Did Biden have the authority to do something that's unthinkable, have open borders where millions of people poured into our country, totally unvetted and totally unchecked, just as you would say. And many of those people were criminals,"" the president added. ""Many of them were from jails and prisons and mental institutions and gang members and drug dealers and very dangerous people. Many were murderers. We have 11,088 that we know of murderers. They murdered of that number. At least half killed more than one person. HEARING SET FOR TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER FEDERAL JUDGE’S BLOCK OF DEPORTATION FLIGHTS Mugshots of suspected members of the violent Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang appear over an image of guns from a video that a gang member allegedly shared on WhatsApp.(Queens DA's Office) ""So, when you asked me if we have the authority, did Biden have the authority to allow millions of people to come into our country? Many of these people are hardened criminals at the top of the line who have caused tremendous damage,"" the president added. The administration is facing legal action over using the Alien Enemies Act against suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump designated a foreign terrorist organization. TheAmerican Civil Liberties Unionargues it is an ""unlawful and unprecedented invocation of the act,"" according to its website. IMMIGRATION IS DRIVING TRUMP'S POPULARITY, SAYS MATTHEW CONTINETTI Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., March 13, 2023.(Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty=) The action is leading to a tense discussion over the relationship between federal judges and the administration after U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Columbia James Boasberg temporarily blocked the use of the act, but the court battle continues Friday. ""What the ACLU is seeking in this case is unprecedented — that a single unelected judge take upon himself the authority to micromanage the national defense of our nation. This would be a complete corruption of the principle of separation of powers, which is a bedrock feature of our Republic enshrined in the Constitution,"" America First Legal Senior Counsel James Rogers said in a statement Friday, according to a news release on AFL's brief in the case.During the Biden administration, there were millions of migrant encounters along the border. Since Trump took office, the Department of Homeland Security swapped out the CBP One app, which people crossing could use to attempt to get asylum in the United States. The CBP Home app is meant for self-deportation. Cameron Arcand is a politics writer at Fox News Digital in Washington D.C.

ABC and its late-night starJimmy Kimmelare facing growing backlash over the liberal host making light of the increased violent attacks on Tesla vehicles and dealerships. During Tuesday night's monologue, Kimmel had fun at the expense of Tesla CEO and DOGE chief Elon Musk over his company's stock tanking ""almost disastrously so,"" sparking massive cheers from his audience. ""People have been vandalizing Tesla vehicles, new Tesla vehicles. Please don't vandalize— don't ever vandalize Tesla vehicles,"" Kimmel said to the camera before smiling with a comedic pause. Musk responded on X, saying, ""He’s such an unfunny jerk."" ELON MUSK CALLS JIMMY KIMMEL AN ‘UNFUNNY JERK’ AFTER HE APPEARS TO MAKE LIGHT OF TESLA ATTACKS Both Jimmy Kimmel and ABC are facing mounting backlash over his joke critics say encouraged domestic terrorism as he made light of the ongoing Tesla attacks.(ABC/Randy Holmes) Kimmel followed up on Wednesday night, saying, ""I mentioned last night multiple Teslas were burned at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas. Authorities are now investigating which Teslas were set on fire — and which set themselves on fire."" ""And while no one should be setting anything on fire, ever, people are mad at Elon Musk for randomly and gleefully putting thousands of Americans out of work, including veterans. But the MAGA gang – which has been very against any kind of violent protest since January 7, was it? 2021? That’s when they started being against it, they are highly upset,"" he added, taking a shot at the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters. Disney-owned ABC has long been perceived as a liberal network by critics and adversarial to PresidentDonald Trump. Its presidential debate, co-moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, was panned by conservatives for itsone-sided fact-checking, and former Vice President Kamala Harris' friendship with Disney exec Dana Walden, who oversees all of ABC programming, raised eyebrows. It seemed that ABC was trying to turn a new leaf with Trump upon his return to office bysettling his defamation lawsuitagainst the network in December over comments made by anchor George Stephanopoulos. But the Kimmel controversy has reignited animus.

""Bob, are you OK with this seeming glorification of violence? Is this the inclusive woke, DEI, the ABC Disney brand?"" Hannity asked. ""You're the CEO of Disney. Are you proud of this?"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, similarly slammed the network, asking, ""Does ABC approve of Jimmy Kimmel’s on-air incitement of criminal behavior? Will ABC take any action or make any statement in response to it? If not, why not?"" CNN commentator Scott Jennings reacted, ""The message from the American Left to conservatives is unmistakable: silence yourselves, or we will do it for you. This isn’t comedy - these are marching orders."" ""ABC and Disney are just allowing this third-place, fifth-rate late-night host to advocate firebombings and shootings at Tesla dealerships.

""If you go to a ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ viewing, you have to really be a humorless scold. So I hope that's isolated to a very small number of people.""

www.foxnews.com,America's biggest bank quietly rebrands 'woke' program after getting caught,https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-rebrands-diversity-program,"FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo on the latest change to JPMorgan Chase's diversity program as the big bank reaffirms its commitment to hiring, compensation and promotions that are merit-based. Wall Street titan JPMorgan Chase is making changes to itsdiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)program as part of ongoing reforms the bank has been making to keep up with the market and current laws, according to a memo seen by FOX Business. JPMorgan Chase Chief Operating Officer Jenn Piepszak told employees in the Friday memo that the bank is replacing the word ""equity"" with ""opportunity."" The program will now be referred to as diversity, opportunity and inclusion (DOI), and will continue to report to Thelma Ferguson. ""The ‘e’ always meant equal opportunity to us, not equal outcomes, and we believe this more accurately reflects our ongoing approach to reach the most customers and clients to grow our business, create an inclusive workplace for our employees and increase access to opportunities,"" Piepszak said in the memo. DISNEY INVESTOR PLEDGES TO CONTINUE FIGHT AS SHAREHOLDERS REJECT PROPOSAL TO DISTANCE COMPANY FROM LGBT GROUP The bank has already streamlined diversity programs that were managed centrally by the DOI organization, meaning that some programs have been integrated into different lines of business, including human resources or corporate responsibility, according to Piepszak. JPMorgan also said it was increasing connectivity between councils, executive forums, business resource groups and the DOI organization ""to ensure consistent operating principles and maximum impact."" This means that ""activities, councils or chapters may be consolidated"" to streamline its process, Piepszak added. JPMorgan said it is making the changes to keep up with the market and current laws.(Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images) The company plans to also reduce the volume of trainings on such topics. Piepszak said the company has always been committed tohiring, compensation and promotionthat are merit-based. ""We work to reduce barriers, not standards, because we know that when you reduce standards, nobody wins,"" Piepszak said. ""We do not have illegal quotas or pay incentives, and we would never turn someone away because of their political or religious beliefs, or because of who they are."" COSTCO DEFENDS DEI PROGRAM AS OTHER MAJOR RETAILERS DROP CONTROVERSIAL DIVERSITY PUSH JPMorgan told employees in the Friday memo that the bank is replacing the word ""equity"" with ""opportunity,"" and renaming the program ""Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion.""(DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images) The firm did not define the changes as a ""corrective action,"" but rather as part of its organic evolution. It noted that it has been making changes to its diversity programs since 2023. The memo came just weeks after the bank agreed to update their code of conduct to protect against religious and political discrimination. The Diversity & Inclusion section of their code of conduct clearly prohibits discrimination against ""religious views,"" and includes language prohibiting discrimination againstcustomers for their ""political opinions."" A growing number of companies – from banks to retailers – have made similar announcements as pressure mounts on major corporations to scale back on initiatives that purport to increase racial and gender equality in the workplace. The initiatives have also faced fierce criticism from PresidentDonald Trump,who signed an executive order in January directing government agencies to investigate DEI programs at publicly traded corporations, large nonprofit corporations or associations and foundations with assets of at least $500 million.

www.foxnews.com,"Diabetes risk lowered by eating one surprisingly sweet food, study suggests",https://www.foxnews.com/health/diabetes-risk-lowered-eating-surprisingly-sweet-food-study-shows,"Fruit is widely regarded as a healthy food — but is there such a thing as too much? Harvard researcher Nick Norwitz explores the benefits and risks of consuming large quantities of different types of fruit. Mangoes may be linked to lower insulin resistance, a factor involved in theprevention of diabetes, a new study published in the journal Nutrients suggests. Researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology examined how eating fresh mangoes affected inflammation and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adults with low-grade chronic inflammation, as reported by SWNS. Then they compared this to consuming the same calorie content ofItalian ice, a frozen, sweetened dessert similar to sorbet. DISEASE STARTS ON YOUR PLATE, CARDIOLOGIST SAYS — HERE'S WHAT TO CHANGE The study included 48 individuals between the ages of 20 and 60. Other than eating the allotted amount of mango (two pre-portioned cups a day), the participants were instructed to maintain their normaldiet and lifestyle. Participants who ate mangoes experienced reductions in insulin resistance, the study found.(iStock) The participants who ate mangoes experienced ""significant"" reductions in insulin resistance. Beta-cell function, the ability of the pancreas to produce and release insulin to manage normal glucose concentrations, also significantly improved. After four weeks, those in the mango group also had significantly lower insulin concentrations compared to the start of the study, while no changes were observed in the control group. FRUIT AS A FOOD CHOICE COMES WITH A CAVEAT: HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH? ""Managing blood glucose isn’t just about monitoring blood sugar levels — it’s about improving insulin sensitivity,"" said study leader and professor Indika Edirisinghe, as SWNS noted. ""Our study suggests that adding fresh mangoes to the diet can be a simple, enjoyable way for people who areoverweight or have obesityto support better insulin function and reduce type 2 diabetes risk."" ""Our study suggests that adding fresh mangoes to the diet can be a simple, enjoyable way for people who are overweight or have obesity to support better insulin function and reduce type 2 diabetes risk.""(iStock) New Jersey-based dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade, author of ""2-Day Diabetes Diet,"" spoke with Fox News Digital about the study's findings. ""Mangoes can be a great addition to a diabetes meal plan, but they are not the only food that can provide these benefits,"" she said, citing almonds, avocados and berries asother foodswith protective benefits. EATING ONE TYPE OF FRUIT COULD LOWER DEPRESSION RISK, STUDY SHOWS While mangoes are rich in nutrients and provide a good source of fiber, consumers must remember that the fruit is still a carbohydrate, Palinski-Wade noted. Carbohydrate balance throughout the day is important for blood sugar management, according to the expert. Carbohydrate balance throughout the day is important for blood sugar management. ""Addinglean protein and good fatsto the plate at the same time as consuming mango will allow you to enjoy the beneficial nutrients without worrying about a spike in blood sugar level,"" she advised. Despite eating calorically comparable foods, body composition remained stable in the mango group, while the control group experienced a slight but significant increase in body weight, the researchers found. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Markers of inflammation and glucose levels were not significantly different between the two groups at the end of the study, leading the researchers to conclude that mangoes are a""heart-healthy"" swapfor calorically comparable sweet treats. ""The improvement in insulin sensitivity in the mango group, without changes in body weight, is noteworthy – which counters misconceptions about mangoes’ natural sugar content and impact on obesity and diabetes,"" Edirisinghe added, as reported by SWNS. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER ""These findings support previous research showing that eating mango does not lead to weight gain, and while the exact mechanism is still unknown, the role of improved antioxidant status from mango consumption may be the mediating factor on blood glucose control."" The role of improved antioxidant status from mango consumption may be the mediating factor in blood glucose control, the researchers found.(iStock) Naturally occurring sugars are found in many beneficial nutrients, including fiber and antioxidants, which is why they have less of an impact on blood sugar than added sugars in foods, according to Palinski-Wade. ""However, they are still a source of carbohydrates and can raise blood sugar levels,"" she cautioned. ""If you add mangoes for the blood-sugar benefits, space your intake out during the day."" ""Mangoes can be a great addition to a diabetes meal plan, but they are not the only food that can provide these benefits."" The expert called for more research to better understand the full impacts of mango on blood sugar. ""But this study, along with others, continues to show that fruit should not be off-limits with diabetes, and that recommended whole fruits, like mango, can be an effective way to enjoy sweet satisfaction while reducing added sugars in the diet and improving overall blood sugar regulation.""

Fox News averaged 3 million viewers during the week of March 10-16 compared to Disney-owned ABC’s 2.8 million and NBC’s 2.6 million average viewers. A cable channel such as Fox News outdrawing major broadcast networks is momentous as it is available in fewer homes across America and a cable subscription is required. While Fox News topped free TV offerings on ABC and NBC, it also completely dominated cable peers. Fox News’ primetime audience of 3 million doubled No. 2 ESPN’s 1.5 million average viewership while beating MSNBC and CNNcombined.

Fox News also topped cable news among the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults aged 25-54, averaging 361,000 demo viewers during primetime compared to 115,000 for CNN and 99,000 for MSNBC. It was much of the same among total day viewers, as Fox News averaged 234,000 demo viewers compared to 72,000 for CNN and a dismal 54,000 for MSNBC, which has struggled in the key metric. OVER 10 MILLION VIEWERS WATCHED FOX NEWS' INAUGURATION COVERAGE, CRUSHING ALL OTHER NETWORKS ""The Five,"" with Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, Jeanine Pirro and rotating co-hosts Jessica Tarlov and Harold Ford Jr., averaged 4.1 million viewers to lead all of cable news.(FOX News media) FX, ESPN 2, Food Network, TNT, ID Discovery, HGTV and Comedy Central were among the 12 basic cable offerings to draw more of the viewers most sought-after by advertisers than MSNBC.

www.foxnews.com,Did the National Weather Service capture a photo of Bigfoot during a storm survey?,https://www.foxweather.com/lifestyle/big-foot-sasquatch-messmore,"FOX Nation's Abby Hornacek shares inside look on how to explore some the country's vast wilderness. MESSMORE, Pa. –Meteorologists with the National Weather Service say they never know what they'll encounter during a storm survey and while it's not unusual to come across something unexpected, discovering a mysterious creature lurking in the background of one of their photos certainly makes for a memorable experience. During a recent investigation into damage caused bysevere weather, something unusual was spotted beyond a fallen tree - the appearance of what many refer to as ""Bigfoot."" The sighting occurred in Fayette County,Pennsylvania, an area nestled within the hills and the higher terrain of the Allegheny Mountains, north of West Virginia. The figure appeared to be human-sized, if not larger, as it walked through the wooded landscape, but, according to an NWS meteorologist, there is no need to worry, as what was spotted was likely something purposely staged to add a bit of fun to people's lives. Locals said it's rather common for residents to create figures out of iron or other similar materials, either for decoration or to spark curiosity from passersby. National Weather Service damage survey in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. (NOAA) GIANT BUG FOUND AT AN ARKANSAS WALMART IDENTIFIED AS A JURASSIC-ERA INSECT While the recent sighting may not have been an actual living creature, there have been historical reports of similar-sized entities in the region. According to thePennsylvania Bigfoot Society, in 1977, a family driving along a dark stretch of a nearby roadway spotted a six-foot-tall figure covered in shaggy, reddish-brown hair. When they shined their headlights at it, the creature reportedly disappeared over a 40-foot embankment, never to be seen again. In 2004, in nearby Greene County, two friends reported seeing a 7-foot-tall creature making cat-like noises during their bike ride, and in 2013, a man reported seeing an 8-foot-tall creature with caveman-like features in the far distance. According to theBigfoot Field Researchers Organization, Pennsylvania is often a hotspot for sightings and ranks in the top ten of states with the most reports. The earliest reports of Sasquatch sightings date back to at least the 1800s,according to the State of Washington. Many of these early cases lacked photos or video evidence, so they were often dismissed as misunderstandings or gags. Advancements in technology have led to numerous modern sightings captured on video or in photos, fueling ongoing debate about the existence of these creatures. WAR TROPHY FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON'S ARMY DISCOVERED AMID BRITISH SHIPWRECK Despite actually seeing apparitions of a figure, many believe there's more to these encounters than meets the eye. Studies over the years have pointed to some sightings actually being large bears, while others could be pranks or attempts by people to simply gain attention. For now, there’s no conclusive evidence to prove the existence of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or whatever name you prefer to call it. So, if you ever find yourself driving along Messmore Road in Fayette County, don't be alarmed if you spot something out of the ordinary - it simply appears to be a lawn decoration meant to capture a passerby’s imagination.",2025-03-22 00:41:21

www.foxnews.com,Little kids and their parents are walking out of the Trump-hating Snow White remake,https://www.outkick.com/culture/little-kids-parents-walking-out-trump-hating-snow-white-remake,"I know we wrote about it last night, but thisSnow Whiteremake is so bad, it deserves another story. That's how awful these reviews are. I'm double-dipping! Look, we've all known for months now that this remake was going to be a disaster. The lead actress is a Trump-hater, the fact she's not white (Snow White is white, shockingly) has been a point of contention, and the plot has been completelywokeifiedby the insufferable scums who run Disney. So, yes – these reviews ain't surprising. But buddy, they are FUNNY. Sad, depressing, not surprising … but funny as hell. God, I love this country. So, let's go ahead and dive right in to some of the most brutal takedowns, courtesy of our friends over at Rotten Tomatoes. By the way, for those wondering … A little more than 18 hours in, and this Snow White remake is currently sitting at a solid 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. That is NOT certified fresh, for those who don't know how that site works. These are all audience reviews, by the way. Ian did thecritics' reviews last night. They were not good, either. Shocking. Got invited by a friend: ""it can't be as bad, as the internet want it to be"". HE left after the first half of the movie, and I followed. Having seen the original several times with my niece, she keep leaning over to me and telling me she rather the video, she did like the costume of the Queen. The best part of the movie for her was the nachos and chili and cheese. Worst movie I’ve ever seen. Can’t believe I wasted 109 minutes of my life on this crap. This is the worst adaptation I’ve seen. This movie wasn't as bad as everyone has been saying it was going to be. Actually, it was much, much worse. Save some money, pop-in the original version DVD (or VHS) and enjoy the real Snow White and the wonderful story it is. Everyone involved in this AI trash fire belongs in prison. How can you fumble such an easy win like this? It's over the top and unnatural in all the worse ways feasible. Making SNOW WHITE brown and making the dwarfs look like PS1 Hagrid were all bold choices indeed. If I saw this movie on a plane, I would still walk out... Very bad film, Rachael Ziegler is insufferable as the princess and Gal cant act. Film is a Frankenstein mess of ideas and really hates the original, awful movie My girl didn't expect to see a brown SNOW WHITE and she cried. So this movie sucks. There is just no way that last one is true, but it's funny. Could you imagine a three-year-old showing up to a movie and crying because the lead role had been race-swapped? God, I'd love to see video of that. Would be hilarious. Anyway, it's all a predictable disaster for Disney, which is surely set to lose millions on this woke garbage. And make no mistake about it – it is WOKE. Look no further than Snow White herself – Rachel Zegler – who not four months ago wished evil on Donald Trump and all of his supporters. Seriously: Yeah, I mean – what are we doing here? I can't believe Disney just refuses to learn from their mistakes. Time and time again they make these awful movies that appeal to 1% of the population, and they always, always, always bomb. They've even somehow managed to ruin Star Wars, which was pretty universally loved until those dummies got their slimy hands on it. Anyway, do you know how I know this Snow White is truly terrible? When I look at who actuallylikesit: Variety, Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times all loved it. That literally tells me everything I need to know. Oh well.

www.nbcnews.com,Judges show frustration with Trump's government as he ramps up attacks on them,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/judges-stand-firm-trump-ramps-attacks-judiciary-rcna197287,"Several federal judges expressed frustration this week with how President Donald Trump’s administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as Trump and his allies got evenmore aggressivein their criticism of the judiciary. Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who temporarily halted deportations being carried out under the rarely usedAlien Enemies Act, while also blasting the jurist on his Truth Social platform as a “grandstander” whose rulings are “inept.” The Trump administration currently has over 15 appeals pending, including from rulings this week reining in the power of Elon Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency. Here’s a look at the major legal developments of the past seven days: Lawyers for the Justice Department chided U.S. District JudgeJames Boasbergforpressing them for answersafter they appeared to ignore his directive over the weekend that any flights carrying out deportations under the AEA should return to the U.S., accusing him of “[c]ontinuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts.” At a hearing Friday, Boasberg told DOJ lawyers their filings had “the kind of intemperate and disrespectful language I’m not used to hearing from the United States.” Chief Justice John Robertsissued a statementTuesday pushing back on Trump and his allies for calling for Boasberg’s removal, saying that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.” Boasberg on Saturday issued a temporary order barring the administration from deporting people byinvokingthe AEAand ordered any such flights that were in the air to return to the U.S. There were two flights that did not return — the government claimed they were already out of U.S. airspace, so the deportees were already technically “removed” from the country. At a hearing on Monday, the judge called the government’s arguments a “stretch” and summarized them as “we don’t care, we’ll do what we want.” He ordered the Justice Department to turn over more information about the flights the next day, leading to the days of pushback by the administration, which claimed he was not entitled to ask questions relating to the AEA, a wartime statute that dates back to 1798. The act had previously only been invoked during major wars — the War of 1812 and both world wars. A Trump proclamation last week applied it to members ofTren De Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration has declared to be a foreign terrorist organization. The proclamation said the gang “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.” That led to the suit brought on behalf of five Venezuelan nationals the government is trying to deport under the act, and who maintain they’re not members of the gang. Boasberg has not yet made any finding on the plaintiffs’ claim that the AEA cannot apply to a gang from a country the U.S. is not at war with, but Trump has continued accusing him of trying to “usurp” his power. “No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result,” he wrote inaTruth Socialposton Friday morning. A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday signed a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE’s access to sensitive records for millions of Americans housed at the Social Security Administration. The “millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent” contain “sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,” U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a137-page opinion. That information “includes Social Security numbers, personal medical and mental health records, driver’s license information, bank account data, tax information, earnings history, birth and marriage records, home and work addresses, school records, immigration and/or naturalization records, health care providers’ contact information, family court records, and employment and employer records,” she noted, adding the office hadn’t put forward a rationale for needing such access. “The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,” Hollander wrote, describing the administration’s methods as “tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.” Herorderbarred DOGE from accessing any more sensitive records and directed it to “disgorge and delete” any such data it has, as well as barring it from “installing any software” on SSA information systems. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Maryland found Musk and DOGE’s work to largely dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development “likelyviolated the United States Constitutionin multiple ways.” U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang said “the power to act to eliminate federal agencies resides exclusively with Congress” and that DOGE’s work to dismantle USAID violates the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution. The government argued that Musk is merely an adviser to the president and was not responsible for efforts to slash the workforce and shutter USAID headquarters. The judge, however, pointed to numerous posts of Musk’s on his X platform where he boasted he was responsible, including a Feb. 3 tweet where he wrote, “We spent the weekend feeding USAID to the wood chipper. Could have gone to some great parties. Did that instead.” Chuang issued a preliminary injunction ordering the agency to take steps to reopen the agency’s headquarters and to restore access to email, payment, security notification and other electronic systems for all USAID employees and contractors. Chuang also barred DOGE from sharing the personal information of USAID staffers outside of the agency, citing the Musk team’s “extremely troubling lack of respect for security clearance requirements and agency rules relating to access to sensitive data.” DOGE filed an appeal of Chuang’s order early Friday. Not every plaintiff that sued DOGE this week was successful in court. The U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit funded by Congress and dedicated to conflict resolution, went to D.C. federal court seeking an emergency restraining order alleging that DOGE had used a “takeover by force” of its headquarters and was attempting to shut it down. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned DOGE’s methods at a Wednesday hearing. “I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do,” Howell said, but shedeclined to signthe restraining order, saying the plaintiffs had not met the necessary requirements. The Justice Department had contended the administration “acted in accordance with all laws” and had properly removed the institute’s top officials. Though Howell ruled in the government’s favor, the Justice Department moved Friday to remove her from another case involving the president. Howell signed off on a restraining order barring portions of  Trump’s executive order punishing Perkins Coie, a law firm that’s done high-profile work for Democrats. The order suspended employees’ security clearances and barred them from federal buildings. “It sends chills down my spine when you say that if the president in his view has the position that an individual, or an entity, or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation’s interest, he can issue an executive order like this,” Howell said at a hearing last week, calling it “a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise.” The DOJ filing said the judge “has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President” over the years, and cited her having signed off on parts of special counsel Jack Smith’s investigations into Trump as one of the reasons she should recuse herself. Another federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction barring the Defense Department from implementing Trump’s executive orderbanning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes found the ban is “soaked in animus” and violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex. “Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,”she wrote, adding that the government failed to produce evidence about how many transgender service members there are, or how transgender status impacts their military readiness. “Transgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed their service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs’ service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence,” Reyes wrote. At a hearing Friday, the government argued, as it had previously, that the order is focused on people with the medical condition “gender dysphoria.” Reyes pointed to a Feb. 27 tweet by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declaring that “Transgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.” “I am not going to abide by government officials saying one thing to the public — saying what they really mean to the public — and coming in here to the court and telling me something different, like I’m an idiot,” Reyes told the DOJ attorney assigned to this case. “I am not an idiot.” The Justice Department later called Reyes’ injunction “the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people who overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump.” Yet another D.C. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to terminate up to $20 billion in grants for climate initiatives, in a case brought by the environmental group Climate United Fund. The money for the “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund” had been appropriated by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by then-President Joe Biden. Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, vowed to recover those funds after he was sworn in in January, saying “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal,” according to a court filing. The agency froze the account and later terminated the grants to the three nonprofits, which alleged the EPA didn’t follow proper procedures for terminating such grants. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed. “When the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of the agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal justification for the termination,” Chutkan wrote. She said that while the EPA voiced concerns regarding “program integrity” and “programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse,” “vague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.” Dareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.

www.nbcnews.com,Legal community shaken by a powerful law firm's decision to give in to Trump's demands,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/legal-community-shaken-powerful-law-firm-paul-weiss-trump-rcna197490,"WASHINGTON — On Thursday, the powerful law firm Paul Weiss caved. It agreed to give Donald Trump’s administration $40 million in free legal work for causes the president supports and, according toa social media post from Trump, get rid of any internal diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, Trump rescinded hisexecutive order that targeted the firmand could have cost it significant business. The agreement shocked many in the legal community, and for Rachel Cohen, an associate at another large firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP — it was the final straw. On Thursday night, Cohen fired off an email to her firm that said she was giving her two-weeks’ notice, unless leaders there agreed to a number of conditions that would, in effect, stand up to the Trump administration — including by refusing to cooperate with the targeting of DEI programs. “This is not what I saw for my career or for my evening, but Paul Weiss’ decision to cave to the Trump administration on DEI, representation and staffing has forced my hand,” Cohen wrote in her firmwide email, whichwent viral on social mediaafter she shared it publicly. “We do not have time. It is now or it is never, and if it is never, I will not continue to work here.” Representatives for Paul Weiss, Skadden and the White House did not immediately return requests for comment. Cohen told NBC News on Friday that her calculus wasn’t whether her letter was going to backfire, nor was it whether she was going to be fired. (Cohen said her email access was suspended soon after she sent her letter.) Her key question was: “Is this going to be unhelpful to the aim that I am working towards, which is the protection of not just my colleagues, but the rule of law in the United States of America? Because the stakes really are that high.” Cohen said she consulted with a family member and had a close friend from law school look over her draft. And then she pushed send. One of the challenges, Cohen said, is that this administration is able to inflict permanent damage before the court system has a chance to catch up. “They move so quickly that you have to make judgment calls — that can cost you a lot — off of what you think is going to happen next, because you do not have time to wait it out and see what happens next, you will be too far behind,” she said. Cohen said she didn’t want to be in this position and wishes she weren’t. She believes “a coup” is happening in America right now. She wishes the most powerful attorneys in the country had immediately banded together and decided to send a clear message thatTrump’s actionswere unacceptable. “We are in this moment where the president is testing what he can get away with and whether the structures that we have in this country that are supposed to prevent us from having a dictator will hold,” she said. “We are not the first or the biggest line of defense. The big law firms are not going to save us, but we are a brick in a wall, and we’re pretty close to the bottom.” Cohen’s message highlighted conversations that are happening behind the scenes at law firms and within the Justice Department in the chaotic two months since Trump took office. Trump has directly targeted corporate law firms by issuing executive orders that either strip lawyers of security clearance or prevent them from working with the federal government. The decision by Paul Weiss sent shockwaves through the corporate legal world, with lawyers worrying that it emboldens the administration to take similar action against more firms. One lawyer with a large firm in Washington said the move by Paul Weiss to make a deal was “as craven and despicable a decision as you will find.” The agreement “will make other law firms more scared” and less likely to publicly stand up for the profession, said the lawyer, who, like others in this article, requested anonymity out of fear of retribution. Any joint effort by firms to make a public stand against Trump has so far fizzled, although there is an ongoing discussion among firms overfiling an amicus briefin a case brought by Perkins Coie against an executive order Trump issued targeting that firm, the lawyer said. Reluctance about speaking up is driven mostly by commercial interests, namely the fear of losing clients, the lawyer added. “The conversations are happening at the firms. The people that I know in the law will say out loud, ‘This is what is happening.’ And they are just scared, and they’re hiding behind notions of fiduciary duty,” Cohen said. A lawyer at another major law firm said the justification their firm has used for keeping its head down is that it needs to keep its management team happy — not look out for the welfare of the country. The lawyer said the Trump administration’s goal appeared to be to bankrupt several of the big law firms. George Conway, a frequent Trump critic anda former partner at a major law firm, told NBC News that firms need to look beyond the bottom line. “They have a moral duty to defend the very system that has allowed them to make the kind of money that they make. These law firms are now basically so profit-driven that they are putting their own economic interests...above the system,” Conway said. “That to me is not only morally appalling and morally fraught and just contemptible, but at the end of the day, self-defeating.” Asked by NBC News what message she had for those in positions of power who are staying quiet, Cohen said: “Their silence is not only not going to protect them, it is going to kill people.” At the Justice Department — with lawyers being fired or reassigned if they worked on cases or in areas that are not what the Trump administration wants — lawyers looking for the exits are finding a tough job market. “Everyone is now constantly looking over their shoulder, wondering if they say the wrong thing to the wrong person or in a monitored chat they could lose their job,” a Justice Department attorney said. “If they don’t work cases that are ‘aligned with Trump’s priorities’ they could lose their job. If they touch a case against a person with certain political affiliations or connections to the White House, they could lose their job.” Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney with a focus on national security law, said that he had a “wave of emotions” over the Paul Weiss decision, from “intense anger to intense sadness about how pathetic” he thought the decision was. Zaid said the targeting of law firms reminded him of a line from Shakespeare’s “Henry VI,” in which a character named Dick the Butcher says, “Let’s kill all the lawyers.” “Everybody always looks at that statement as if it is an assault, attack, insult against lawyers,” Zaid said. “It’s actually quite the opposite, because Dick the Butcher was an authoritarian who was trying to take power, and he had to kill all the lawyers because the lawyers were the only ones who could get in his way and stop him. And I think what Trump is doing is exactly that.” Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News. Lawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:47:52
www.nbcnews.com,The salary you need to be considered middle class in every U.S. state,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/salary-need-considered-middle-class-every-us-state-rcna197508,"A six-figure household income doesn’tnecessarily make you rich— in many cases, it just means you’re middle class. The upper bound of what’s considered middle class for households exceeds $100,000 in every U.S. state, according to aSmartAsset analysis of 2023 income data, the most recent available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The report, which crunched the numbers for all 50 states, is based onPew Research’s definition of middle class: two-thirds to double the median household income. On that measure, Massachusetts has the highest threshold for middle-class salaries, overtaking New Jersey from last year’s rankings. A household there needs between $66,565 and $199,716 to be considered middle class, with the upper boundary increasing by nearly $11,000 from the previous report. Even as more households earn six-figure salaries, many middle-class earners are feeling the squeeze. While inflation-adjusted wages haverisen since 2022, those gains have beenlargely offsetby increasing costs since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Housing and food, in particular, have become more expensive. From January 2020 to December 2024, home prices climbed 52%, according to theCase-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, while food prices rose 30%, based onConsumer Price Indexdata. Over the same period, overall inflation grew 25%. Rising costs help explain whytwo-thirds of middle-class Americanssaid they were struggling financially and didn’t expect their situation to improve in a2024 surveyfrom the National True Cost of Living Coalition. Since then, year-over-year inflation has hoveredaround 3%, still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target but far below itsJune 2022 peak of 9.1%. But although price increases have slowed, the cumulative effect of the past few years has eroded many Americans’ spending power. As a result, a six-figure income may not stretch as far as it once did. Below, see what’s considered middle class in your state.

www.nbcnews.com,A meat allergy caused by ticks may be popping up in new parts of the U.S.,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/alpha-gal-syndrome-tick-induced-red-meat-allergy-may-caused-species-rcna197172,"It’s rare, but in some cases a tick bite can cause a person to develop an allergy to red meat. Most cases, scientists believe, are linked to the lone star tick, a species typically found in the Southeastern U.S. and the lower Midwest. Two case reports published this week, however, suggest that two other species — found elsewhere in the country — may also trigger the allergy. When ticks bite, they release a steady stream of saliva that contains chemicals that keep their victim’s blood flowing as they feed. Sometimes, the saliva contains a sugar molecule called alpha-gal. Alpha-gal syndrome, a reaction to the molecule that occurs in some people, causesa red meat allergy. “Alpha-gal syndrome is relatively rare, but those who have it can have a full-on anaphylactic shock,” said Douglas Norris, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The Center for Disease Control and Preventionestimatesnearly half a million people in the U.S. have alpha-gal syndrome. “We do believe the lone star tick is still responsible for most of the cases of alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S.,” said Dr. Johanna Salzer, a veterinary medical officer and epidemiologist with the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. Salzer worked on both of the new case reports, which were published Wednesday in the agency’s journal,Emerging Infectious Diseases. Those reports found cases of alpha-gal syndrome inWashingtonandMainein two women who hadn’t traveled to areas where the lone star tick typically lives. Both women reported being bitten by ticks, which suggests that other species — includingIxodes scapularis,also calledblack-legged or deer ticks — may also be associated with alpha-gal syndrome, though much more rarely.A related tick,Ixodes pacificus, or the western black-legged tick, was also linked to the Washington case. The CDC’smap of suspected cases— which shows high concentrations in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Tennessee as well as Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia — “would look very different ifIxodes scapulariswas widely causing it,” Salzer said. However, documented cases being associated with other ticks in the U.S. is “certainly a big deal,” Matthew Aliota, an associate professor in the department of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota. UnlikeLyme diseaseor theHeartland virus, alpha-gal syndrome is not caused by a bacterium or virus. The syndrome is instead an immune reaction to alpha-gal, a sugar found in almost all nonprimate animals, including cows, horses and deer and which can be present in tick saliva. For some people, being exposed to alpha-gal through a tick bite triggers an immunoglobulin E, or IgE, antibody response in the body. People who mount this response develop an allergy to meat that can takeweeks to months to appear. Alpha-gal syndrome was discovered in 2009, and researchers are still working to answer a lot of questions about it — including why some people react to alpha-gal while many do not. For most people who do develop alpha-gal syndrome, the allergic reaction occurs hours after they eat red meat. “It’s unique because it’s a delayed reaction, roughly 2-8 hours, so you can have a hard time knowing the trigger,” Salzer said, noting that with other IgE allergies, such as peanuts or shellfish, the reaction is almost immediate. Different people can also have different reactions, which can furthercomplicate diagnosis. In one case, a 61-year-old woman in Washington state went into anaphylactic shock 29 days after she remembers being bitten by a tick on her shoulder: After eating beef tacos, she broke out in hives and her tongue and throat swelled. It happened again after she ate pork. In the other case, a 45-year-old woman in Maine had stomach pain and general malaise about 2 ½  hours after she ate roasted rabbit. About nine days earlier, she had removed a deer tick from her arm. After that first incident, she’d get sick a few hours after she ate any type of red meat. Beef elicited a bout of vomiting and diarrhea that eventually landed her in her doctor’s office. Both women tested positive for alpha-gal antibodies, and both recalled their bites being itchy and inflamed. “Not everyone will have this local reaction, but it is pretty common,” Salzer said, referring to the itchy, inflamed bites. “But there is a subset of people with alpha-gal syndrome who do not recall being bitten by ticks,” she said. In 2023, the Maine CDC documented 23 cases of confirmed alpha-gal syndrome, but it’s unclear how many may have encountered the ticks while traveling. (Lone star ticks are uncommon in Maine and Washington, but they have been found there.) It’s also possible that these other tick species in the U.S. have always been associated with alpha-gal, Norris said, but doctors haven’t detected it nearly as often as with lone star ticks. Indeed, ticks in Africa, Australia, Central America and Europe and Central America are also known totrigger alpha-gal syndrome. One thing is certain: Ticks, and the diseases they are associated with, are thriving. “Tick populations in general, and particularly with lone star ticks, are exploding all over the United States,” Aliota said. “Lone star ticks are moving into bigger geographic areas, and that range is continuing to expand with climate change.” For this reason, it’s important to take precautions to avoid tick bites. This includes using bug repellant and wearing long-sleeved shirts, pants and socks when outdoors during tick season, which typically begins in April. If you’ve been in wooded areas or tall grass, shower off and do a “tick check” when you get home. “The most important thing is preventing the tick bite altogether,” Salzer said.

www.nbcnews.com,NCAA Tournament: What to watch in Saturday's slate of March Madness games,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/college-basketball/ncaa-tournament-watch-saturdays-slate-march-madness-games-rcna197515,"After an exciting open to the men’s bracket of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday, the second round begins Saturday with some tantalizing matchups. Old coaching rivals will reunite, a Cinderella will try to continue its run, No. 1 seeds will be in action and much more. Here’s a rundown of all the action as teams try to clinch a spot in the Sweet 16. The upset of the tournament so far belongs to the McNeese State Cowboys, who held on for a 69-67 win over fifth-seeded Clemson in the first round. The Cowboys pulled off the shocker in large part due to their defense, which held the Tigers to only 13 points in the first half. The Boilermakers, on the other hand, more or less cruised to a victory over High Point to begin the tournament. Purdue will have to make sure not to underestimate McNeese State the same way Clemson did. If there were ever a matchup to watch simply for the coaches on the sideline, it’s this one. John Calipari’s Arkansas Razorbacks will take on Rick Pitino’s St John’s Red Storm in a battle of not only former national champions, but former Kentucky coaches as well. Pitino’s success at St. John's is one of the more compelling stories of the season, as the storied (and there are lots of stories) coach is trying to make a Final Four with his fourth different team. Meanwhile, Calipari is doing one of his finest coaching jobs in years, and already led the Razorbacks to an upset over Kansas in the first round. The Aggies are slightly favored in this matchup, as the Wolverines are coming off a near-upset in the first round. Michigan was pushed to the limit by UC San Diego, which made a furious second-half comeback and missed a game-tying 3-pointer in the waning seconds of a 68-65 loss. Texas A&M could have its hands full with Michigan center Danny Wolf, however, as the 7-footer is one of the more skilled players taking the floor Saturday. The Bulldogs pulled off a stunner on Thursday, knocking off No. 6 Missouri in a rebuke of theSEC’s regular season dominance. The Red Raiders, meanwhile, cruised to a 10-point victory over UNC Wilmington thanks tohistorical shooting from deep. Keep an eye on Drake guard Bennett Stirtz, who scored 21 points in upset over the Tigers. Stirtz has already led one upset, and has the scoring ability to lead another. The Bluejays led nearly wire-to-wire in their win over Louisville in round one. The Tigers had an even easier time, dispatching Alabama State 83-63. This game should be more competitive for each squad. It will also feature a throwback big-man battle between Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner, a March Madness veteran, and Auburn forward Johni Broome, a Naismith Trophy semifinalist. This could be the closest matchup of the day, as the Badgers are only very slight favorites against the Cougars. Could this be a big moment for Wisconsin guard John Tonje? The sixth-year player is in his first season with the Badgers and had a relatively quiet 15 points in the first round. Having his best season in college, Tonje (plus backcourt mate John Blackwell) will be who BYU has to slow down to advance. Both teams blew out their opening-round opponent, though the Bulldogs’ manhandling of Georgia was a little more surprising than the Cougars’ dismantling of SIU Edwardsville. (Fun fact, both teams played an opponent with the same team name in the Round of 64.) The stylistic clash in the backcourt will be a fun subplot in this game. Houston’s L.J. Cryer is not afraid to let it fly from deep, connecting on 42.3% of his 7.0 3-pointers a night. Gonzaga’s Ryan Nembhard, meanwhile, is a true point guard, leading the nation in assists with 9.8 per game. The nightcap on Saturday’s action should be a fun one. The Bruins and Volunteers each cruised in their first tournament game, but now the competition increases significantly. Can UCLA handle Tennessee’s one-two punch of Chaz Lanier and Zakai Zeigler in the backcourt? Lanier is a score-first guard who is bombs away from deep, while Zeigler is one of the peskiest defenders in the country. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:00
www.nbcnews.com,"Paige Bueckers, JuJu Watkins headline players to watch in women's NCAA Tournament",https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/college-basketball/paige-bueckers-juju-watkins-headline-players-watch-womens-ncaa-tournam-rcna195960,"The first round of theNCAA women’s tournamenttips off Friday, as the South Carolina Gamecocks look to win their second national championship in a row, and third in four seasons. The top teams in the bracket are loaded with talent, however, which means the Gamecocks’ path to repeat won’t be easy. With so many big names in the sport who can make an impact over the next few weeks, here the players you should keep an eye on as teams battle for a spot in the Final Four in Tampa. Watkins is only a sophomore but is arguably the best player in the sport. A certified bucket-getter, Watkins is a multi-level scorer. She finished second in points per game in the regular season, averaging 24.6 points a night. Watkins shoots 6.1 3-pointers per game and is also adept at getting to the free-throw line. Her 8.3 free throws per game were tied for second-most in the country. Last season as a freshman, Watkins led the Trojans all the way to the Elite Eight, where they were bounced out of the tournament by the Connecticut Huskies. Watkins will certainly be motivated to make her first Final Four, and with the Huskies in USC’s region, she could have a chance to earn some revenge as well. Bueckers is the presumed No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. For now, though, she has unfinished business with the Huskies. After missing an entire year due to a torn ACL, Bueckers returned to the floor last season and averaged a career-best 21.9 points per game, leading UConn all the way to the Final Four. This season, Bueckers has sacrificed a tiny bit of scoring to become more of a playmaker, dishing out 4.9 assists a night, her most since her freshman campaign. This is Bueckers’s last shot at returning the Huskies to glory. The storied program hasn’t won a championship since reeling off four straight from 2013 to 2016. Bueckers will have to lead a young squad if she hopes to get the job done this year. A two-way wrecking ball, Hannah Hidalgo improved her efficiency this year after a splashy freshman season. Hidalgo upped her scoring average, field-goal percentage and 3-point field-goal percentage as a sophomore, becoming a formidable combo with senior forward Olivia Miles. While Hidalgo can score with the best of them (she finished fourth in points per game with 24.2), her defense may be even more fun to watch. After averaging a preposterous 4.6 steals per game a season ago, Hidalgo wreaked havoc again this year to the tune of 3.7 takeaways a night. Booker led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight as a sophomore, and remains a great floor raiser for Texas. While Booker may not be as consistent a scorer as some of the other players on this list, she can fill it up once she gets hot. It will also be interesting to see if Booker can overcome her most recent performance, when she was held to only 10 points and no assists in the SEC tournament final by South Carolina. How a player of Booker’s caliber tries to overcome defenses geared to hound her every second she’s on the floor should be one of the more intriguing subplots of the tournament. The woman in the middle, Betts is in her second season with the Bruins after beginning her collegiate career at Stanford. She was a capital-P Problem this year, averaging career bests in points (19.6), rebounds (9.7), and assists (2.8) per game. Standing tall at 6-foot-7, Betts knows how to leverage her size on both ends of the floor. She shoots a high percentage and stays close to the basket offensively, while scaring players away from the rim defensively. Her 2.9 blocks a night were fifth-best in the nation in the regular season. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:02
www.nbcnews.com,No. 2 Alabama survives scare from No. 15 Robert Morris in first round of NCAA Tournament,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/college-basketball/ncaa-tournament-march-madness-alabama-robert-morris-rcna197554,"The No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide survived an upset bid by No. 15 Robert Morris on Friday, winning 90-81 after a close game. The Crimson Tide held a slim 40-36 lead after the first half, but the Colonials were not deterred even after Alabama extended the lead in the second. With a little under 13 minutes to go, a 3-pointer by Derrion Reid gave Alabama a 56-46 lead. That’s when Robert Morris went on a big run. Over the next five-plus minutes of action, the Colonials outscored the Crimson Tide 19-8 to take a 65-64 lead with seven minutes and 10 seconds to go. Alabama immediately answered with a sizable run of its own, however, pulling off an 11-2 stretch to go back ahead 75-66 with a little over three minutes to go. The Crimson Tide would ultimately hold on for the victory. Robert Morris was led by guard Amarion Dickerson, who scored 25 points on 11-of-22 shooting. Dickerson struggled from deep, however, hitting only one of his eight shots from beyond the arc. He also fouled out with a little more than one minute left in the game. Alabama was led by senior star guard Mark Sears, who finished with 22 points, 5 rebounds and 10 assists. Sophomore forward Mouhamed Dioubate added 18 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. The Crimson Tide will now await the winner of St. Mary’s and Vanderbilt in the second round. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:05
www.nbcnews.com,"After two murder trials and a conviction, future of woman accused of poisoning her boss is uncertain",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kaitlyn-conley-murder-trial-mary-yoder-adam-rcna197138,"Her first trial ended with a hung jury. Her second finished with an acquittal on the most serious charge — second-degree murder — and a conviction for the lesser crime of manslaughter. Then, in January, thelegal saga of Kaitlyn Conleytook another unexpected turn: A New York appellate court overturned the 2017 conviction in the fatal poisoning of her boss, a killing the prosecutor had described as “cold-hearted and diabolical.” The problem, the appeals panel concluded, was that her defense had not done enough to stop prosecutors from introducing key evidence — details from Conley’s cellphone obtained through what the ruling described as an improperly written warrant. Conley was released from prison earlier this year, and Oneida County District Attorney Todd Carville is weighing whether his office should pursue a third trial. He told “Dateline” he is reviewing the case. The Oneida County Sheriff’s Department, which investigated the death, did not respond to requests for comment. In the meantime, here are three key moments in the case. MaryYoder, a longtime chiropractor who ran a clinic with her husband outside Utica and was known for her love of health and fitness, was hospitalized with increasingly dire symptoms — vomiting, diarrhea and severe abdominal pain. Although specialists were brought in to treat her, by that night, doctors had provided no answers as to what was making her ill, Yoder’s relatives have told “Dateline.” They had to revive her several times after her heart stopped, they said. Yoder, 60, was pronounced dead the next day. “I remember at the time saying, ‘I don’t understand this,'” Yoder’s daughter, Tamaryn Yoder, told “Dateline.” “If there had been a car accident or something, that I could understand. But I don’t understand this. What happened for her body to just quit? Because it made no sense.” An autopsy later revealed that she had died from colchicine toxicity — a drug used to treat gout. That November, the sheriff’s office received an anonymous letter claiming that Yoder’s son, Adam — then in his mid-20s — had admitted poisoning her. The letter claimed Adam Yoder had bought the drug online, dosed her vitamins with it and stashed the bottle under the front passenger seat of his Jeep, former Oneida County Sheriff’s detective Robert Nelson previously told “Dateline.” The letter’s author claimed Adam Yoder was fueled by anger and a belief that his mother’s death would benefit him financially, Nelson said. In an interview with authorities, Adam Yoder denied the allegations. But when investigators searched his car, Nelson said, they found the container in the precise spot where the letter said it would be. Adam Yoder said the bottle had been planted, Nelson said, and detectives were skeptical of the letter’s claims. If Adam Yoder killed his mother, Nelson recalled thinking, why would he bring evidence of the murder to the sheriff’s office, where he had been interviewed? When they looked into his whereabouts at the time his mother was poisoned, they discovered that he’d been on Long Island — 300 miles away. Eventually, authorities discovered the letter writer’s identity and came to believe that she was responsible for Mary Yoder’s death. That was Kaitlyn Conley, the receptionist at Mary Yoder’s clinic and Adam Yoder’s ex-girlfriend. Conley, then 23, was indicted on charges of second-degree murder, forgery, falsifying business records and two counts of larceny. When detectives questioned her about the letter, she’d been working full time at the clinic for a couple of years and involved in an on-again off-again relationship with Adam Yoder. Conley acknowledged writing the letter andtold the investigators that her ex had confessed to the killing, video of Conley’s interview shows. She told authorities that he had said he regretted doing it. Conley said she hadn’t come forward sooner because she was afraid of him. But when authorities obtained a search warrant for Conley’s cellphone, they discovered that it had been used to search “poison” and “colchicine” multiple times, according to the appeals ruling. And the email used in the drug purchase — “mradamyoder1990@gmail.com”— had been logged into on her device, the ruling states. Detectives used those revelations to uncover another key piece of evidence — that Conley had bought the prepaid debit card used to purchase the colchicine, the ruling states. When Conley’s trial began in April 2017, prosecutor Laurie Lisi pointed out that on the day Mary Yoder fell ill, Conley was the only other person patients saw at the clinic. And Lisi identified a possible motive in the murder: “Kaitlyn Conley wanted Adam Yoder back. And I submit to you, she poisoned Adam Yoder’s mother, her boss, in hopes of bringing Adam Yoder back to her.” That plan briefly worked, Lisi alleged. They got back together after Mary Yoder’s death, but then they split up again and Conley sent the letter identifying Adam Yoder as the killer, the prosecutor said. In interviews with detectives, Conley denied killing her boss. And at trial, her lawyer blamed the death on Mary Yoder’s husband, Bill Yoder, whom she ran the clinic with. According to defense attorney Christopher Pelli, Bill Yoder had the motive — he’d developed a romantic relationship with his wife’s sister and, with a recent inheritance, no longer needed his wife, the primary breadwinner in the relationship — and he had opportunity. Although Conley was the only other employee seen at their office the day Mary Yoder became sick, Pelli said it was Bill Yoder’s practice to get his work done in secret and make sure no patients knew he was there. In an interview with “Dateline,” Pelli disputed the evidence found on Conley’s phone. “The prosecution couldn’t say that, ‘Katie searched this particular term prior to Mary’s death,” he said. “It appeared that it was afterward.” Bill Yoder was never charged in his wife’s death and he told “Dateline” that he did not poison her. In court, he testified that his relationship with Mary Yoder’s sister began after her death. In the first trial, the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict after deliberating for five days and the judge declared a mistrial. During the second trial, which began five months later, Conley’s new defense attorney did not identify Bill Yoder as a possible suspect, but instead focused on his son, Adam. In testimony, Adam Yoder denied the allegations and the prosecution suggested that he, too, may have been poisoned in the months before his mother’s death. After Conley gave him supplements to help boost his memory, Adam Yoder testified, he went to the emergency room with symptoms similar to his mother’s. Conley’s lawyer denied that she had anything to do with his illness and suggested that he’d made himself sick with the colchicine he’d bought to kill his mother. On the second day of deliberations, the jury acquitted Conley of second-degree murder and convicted her of manslaughter. She was sentenced to 23 years in prison. A state appeals court in New York overturned Conley’s manslaughter conviction after she obtained a new lawyer who argued that Pelli failed to properly challenge the warrant that allowed authorities access to Conley’s cellphone. Attorney Melissa Swartz told “Dateline” that Conley, who had been working in the law library at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, first drew her attention to the document, which she described as “probably the most facially insufficient warrant I’ve ever come across.” “They believed that that was a warrant to take her phone and look in it,” said Swartz, who specializes in post-conviction matters. “But what it needs to be is two separate warrants; one to take her phone and then one to actually search her phone.” In2022, Swartz filed a motion seeking to overturn Conley’s conviction that claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and raised a series of issues about her defense. Among them was Pelli’s failure to challenge the warrant on the grounds that it was overbroad. In a hearing on the matter, Pelli acknowledged the error and said he had failed to recognize it as an issue at the time. The district attorney’s office opposed the challenge and a judge denied the motion, writing in a 2024 ruling that because there was no conviction in the first trial, the matter was moot. But Swartz appealed, and in January, the court ruled in Conley’s favor, stating that Pelli’s failure was “sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise her right to a fair trial.” The fact that there had been a mistrial didn’t prevent Conley from pursuing the ineffective assistance claim, the ruling states, noting that the failure to block the warrant in the first trial led to the introduction of cellphone evidence in the second. Conley was released days after the appeals court issued its ruling. The ruling does not address the evidence uncovered from Conley’s cellphone. It states only that in their warrant seeking the device and its contents, authorities did not spell out what they were looking for in connection with Mary Yoder’s death. Swartz told “Dateline” that her role was not to solve the crime and that the effort to overturn Conley’s conviction had not sought to establish her innocence. “We are making sure that the criminal justice system is working correctly,” she said. “That’s important for people that commit crimes, and that’s important for people who have been wrongfully convicted of committing crimes.” Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.",2025-03-22 00:48:07

Her husband, Donald Lantz, 64, received 160 years. “You brought these kids to West Virginia, a place as I know as almost heaven and put them in hell,” Circuit Court Judge MaryClaire Akers said, according to NBC affiliateWSAZof Huntington, West Virginia. “The court will now put you in yours. May God have mercy on your souls, because this court will not,” she said. The couple adopted the children from a shelter for homeless and vulnerable youths. Whitefeather and Lantz were living in Minnesota at the time and moved the children to Washington state in 2018 and then West Virginia in 2023,The Associated Press reported. They were found in October 2023 after Kanawha County Sheriff’s deputies went to the Sissonville home to conduct a welfare check. A neighbor reported seeing Lantz lock a girl and her teenage brother in a shed and leave. The sheriff's office said the two children in the shed had no running water or bathroom and had been ""deprived of adequate hygienic care and food."" The children said they slept on the concrete floor and had been locked inside for about 12 hours before they were found. Another girl was found inside the home. When Lantz arrived home, he had another child with him and led the deputies to a friend’s home where the fifth child was staying,WCHS-TVof Charleston reported. An indictment alleged that the couple targeted the children for forced labor because of their race. They were charged with human trafficking, child neglect, forced labor, and other crimes. Whitefeather apologized to the children during the sentencing. “I just want the court to know that I have made mistakes I am very sorry for that and I love my children and I have never, ever, done anything to my ... children to harm them intentionally,” she said, according to WSAZ. “Children, I do love you.” The oldest child told Whitefeather and Lantz in an impact statement that they were “monsters,” the news station reported. “I will be something amazing,” another child said. “I will be strong and beautiful. You will always be exactly what you are -- horrible.” The youngest child said they were “taught to laugh at” their siblings and had to watch a lot of the abuse. “Now, at my new home, I see that everything was not right with Jeanne and Donald,” the child’s impact statement said. Whitefeather and Lantz were ordered to pay $280,000 in restitution apiece to the victims, WSAZ reported. Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:09
www.nbcnews.com,12-year-old accused of hate crime after 2 Muslim students attacked at Connecticut school,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/12-year-old-accused-hate-crime-2-muslim-students-attacked-connecticut-rcna197583,"A 12-year-old Connecticut student who police say assaulted two of her Muslim classmates has been accused of a hate crime in the attack. Four seventh-grade students were involved in an altercation at Wallace Middle School in Waterbury,  Connecticut, earlier this month, and two 13-year-old Muslim girls were injured, police said. The injured teens regularly wear hijabs, the Connecticut chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CT) has said. Their relatives called for an investigation into the attack, arguing that the teens may have been targeted because of their religion, police said. Waterbury Police on Friday said in a statement that authorities determined ""the altercation was motivated by religion and/or ethnicity."" The 12-year-old was charged in juvenile court with intimidation based on bigotry and bias in the first and second degree, authorities said. A second student has been referred to a youth diversionary program rather than being arrested, police said. Waterbury Mayor Paul Pernerewski said the attack, which happened March 3, was an “isolated incident,” and interim Superintendent of Waterbury Public SchoolsDarren Schwartz said the attack did not represent a bigger issue within the school. “While this was not part of a widespread problem, this is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ensure our students are safe and respectful of one another,” he said in a statement. CAIR-CT called the attack “unacceptable.” “Schools must be safe spaces for all students, regardless of their religion or ethnicity,” Farhan Memon, chair of CAIR-CT, said in a statement. “What reportedly happened to these two girls is unacceptable, and the district has a legal and moral obligation to take decisive action to prevent further harm.” Memon has called on the school district to implement mandatory schoolwide anti-bullying training focused on racial and religious discrimination. “This attack on Muslim students is unacceptable and reflects a broader pattern of bullying and discrimination that must be urgently addressed,” Memon said in a statement. Officials said Friday that the Waterbury Department of Education recognized the attack as bullying, has taken disciplinary action and  implemented enhanced school safety measures.

www.nbcnews.com,"Family of three missing after leaving Grand Canyon vacation, authorities say",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-three-missing-leaving-grand-canyon-vacation-authorities-say-rcna197489,"A family of three is missing after leaving the Grand Canyon and driving through a winter storm earlier this month, Arizona authorities said on Wednesday. Jiyeon Lee, 33, Taehee Kim, 59, and Junghee Kim, 54, were last known to be traveling from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas while on vacation earlier this month, according to a missing person flyer the Coconino County Sheriff's OfficepostedWednesdayon Facebook. The flyer states that the GPS on the family's rental car last showed the vehicle traveling westbound on Interstate 40 on March 13. That day, a multi-car accident occurred on I-40 — an intercontinental highway that stretches from California to North Carolina — but it is unclear if their car was involved in the crash. The family was driving a 2024 white BMW with a California license plate, according to the flyer. A total of 22 vehicles — including multiple tractor-trailers — and 36 drivers and occupants were involved in the incident that left two dead and 16 others injured, the Arizona Department of Public Safety  (ADPS) said in a statement. Neither of the two fatalities were identified as any of the three missing family members, according to the department. The ADPS added that a winter storm was affecting the area at the time of the crash and that ""the road was covered in snow and ice. ""The collision caused a fire which quickly spread to the other involved vehicles and burned for more than 20 hours,"" the department said. A detective assigned to the missing persons case for the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said in a phone call on Friday that authorities did not have any additional information to share at this time. The sheriff's office encouraged anyone who has information about the family or their whereabouts to contact authorities.  Matt Lavietes is a reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:13
www.nbcnews.com,South Florida school teacher was applying for asylum when he was deported to Honduras,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/south-florida-teacher-sauceda-deported-was-seeking-asylum-rcna197566,"From the small living room, in a house tucked away in a tiny and remote Honduran village, Wualner Sauceda recalled what it was like to be deported from the United States. Sauceda, 24, was a rookie science teacher at Palms Spring Middle School in Hialeah, a city in South Florida, when he was detained in early January and deported a month later. “I applied for asylum and that application process took several years,” Sauceda said. His asylum application was eventually denied, and his appeal didn’t go anywhere, he told NBC6 in Miami during anexclusive two-part interview. So he was looking for other legal pathways to remain in the country. Given his unresolved immigration status, Sauceda had tocheck in with immigration officials. Previous appointments were uneventful, and officials would typically issue a follow-up appointment. On Jan. 7, he missed school to go to his appointment at the Miramar immigration office in South Florida. This time, he said, something felt different. “I got there at 8 a.m., and I noticed it was 1 p.m. and then 2 p.m. and then 3 p.m.,” Sauceda said. He was then told to park his car inside the lot. And once inside the government building, he asked officers what was going on. “They told me, 'you’re detained',” said Sauceda, who added it was such a shocking blow that he couldn’t tell his parents. Instead, he called an uncle so he could break the news to the rest of the family. “Emotionally, it was hard for me,” he said. Sauceda now lives with his uncle and maternal grandparents in a rural area three hours northeast of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. Surrounded by dirt roads and mountainous terrain, the family relies partly on what they grow and farm animals they raise. Unlike the United States, most if not all homes in that area, lack running water or air conditioning. A nearby river is their source for water. They use it to bathe and wash. Their drinking water comes from a well. Despite growing up in that setting until he was 13, Sauceda had become used to the comforts of South Florida. “I was born here,”in Honduras, said Sauceda, who added that he and his cousin fled their native country after a close relative had been killed. Migrating to the U.S as a teen remains a vivid memory. “I remember crossing…the river,” he recalled, and he eventually reunited with his parents, who were already in South Florida. He enrolled at Henry H. Filer Middle School in Hialeah for 8th grade, then attended Westland Hialeah Senior High School. Of his early school days, Sauceda said, “I felt that I can do things that I never thought I could do.” He quickly learned English, and by senior year, he was taking advanced courses. “I remember taking honors English for seniors, honors pre-calculus and honors history, and that was something that I really liked because I went from ESOL level 1 to ESOL level 4,” he proudly remembered. Despite his pending immigration case, he had aspirations for more. “I knew that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a kid,” Sauceda remembered fondly. At first, he thought he could be a math teacher, but eventually settled on science and started his college career at Miami-Dade College. Financially though, college was draining because without a work permit, he couldn’t work, and finding scholarship money for undocumented students was tough. But he foundTheDream.us— an organization that claims to have provided more than 10,000 scholarships to undocumented students. Sauceda applied to Florida International University and the University of Central Florida, and got accepted to both, but chose to go to FIU to be closer to his family. In December 2023, Sauceda graduated with a 3.4 grade point average and a bachelor’s in chemistry with a track in education. “This is my diploma from FIU,” he showed with excitement and pride. “I got even happier when I received my teaching certificate.” A month after graduation, he was able to secure a job as a teacher at Miami-Dade Public Schools. “I was a little bit scared because I was not a U.S. citizen and not a permanent resident, but I did have a social security, so that’s how I applied for teacher’s certificate,” he told NBC6. It was a constant fear not just with work, but with life in general and perhaps foreshadowing what was to come. After being detained, he was then transferred to the Broward Transitional Center, a Pompano Beach facility where migrants are held. Sauceda estimates he was at the facility for more than 20 days. His attorney, Ivan Torres Hidalgo Gato, filed for deferred action, but Sauceda said nothing worked. NBC6 contacted Hidalgo Gato with the intention of learning the details of Sauceda’s case, but he told us he was not interested in providing any insight into the Sauceda case. Sauceda said he’ll never forget what an immigration officer told him while he was detained. “He literally said that he was told to start putting people on that plane,” said Sauceda. He was initially detained during the administration of President Joe Biden, but deported on Feb. 6, shortly after President Donald Trump took office. Sauceda recalled being transported to a facility in Louisiana, which he described as a horrible experience. He said the rooms were over capacity, with 60 people in a room made for 24 detainees. “I remember people moving the mattresses to the floor, and I was sleeping on the pure metal of the bed,” Sauceda added. “But during the day, the room would be really, really hot, and then during the night, it would be really, really cold, and I don’t know if they did that on purpose, but it was really bad.” Sauceda recalled he was shackled by his hands, waist and feet before being placed in a deportation flight to Honduras. “It was shocking to me because I have never experienced anything like that,” he said. “Sometimes I think about it and it saddens my heart,” Sauceda said, stoic but certainly with emotion. NBC6 in Miami willair two additional interviewsnext week as part of their four-part series reporting on Sauceda's case. A version ofthis storywas first published onNBCMiami.com.

www.nbcnews.com,The Bidens want back in,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/bidens-want-back-in-rcna196956,"WASHINGTON — Former President Joe Biden has told some Democratic leaders he’ll raise funds, campaign and do anything else necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped design, according to people close to him. Biden privately met last month with the new Democratic National Committee chairman, Ken Martin, and offered to help as the party struggles to regain its viability amid polling that shows its popularity has been sinking, the people said. So far, Biden's overture seems to have fallen flat. Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger. Whoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue. “Who’s going to want Joe Biden back in the game?” said a major Biden supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about him. A spokesperson for the DNC didn’t provide a comment or make Martin available for an interview. A new NBC News pollshows that the Democratic Party’s popularity has dropped to a record low. Only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party — the lowest figure in the network’s polling dating to 1990. Asked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political sphere, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday, “I hope so.” Former first lady Jill Biden is also prepared to campaign and raise money for fellow Democrats as she and her husband settle into life back home in Delaware, a person close to her said. “She recognizes that serving in the capacities that she served is an honor and it comes with responsibilities to the party. And she’s prepared to help in any way she can,” the person said. Both Bidens are carving out post-presidential lives aside from the partisan political work they've volunteered to take on. Each plans to write a book. As Biden develops a theme for his memoir, he has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti. He has been splitting his time between Delaware and Washington for meetings in office space supplied by the federal government. As was his habit as a U.S. senator, he often commutes via Amtrak. The onetime first couple were shocked when Trump abruptly announced this week that he wasending Secret Service protectionfor their two adult children, Hunter and Ashley, the person close to Jill Biden said. They'd gotten no warning, another person familiar with the matter said. Their first question was whether their two children would be safe. The Bidens have been out of office for only two months. After Trump’s first term ended in 2021, then-President Biden extended protection for Trump’s adult children for six months. Though Biden is willing to help, Democrats aren’t unanimous in wanting them to. Some party activists believe Biden is an admired figure who remains a draw inside a grateful party. Jane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, said in an interview: “If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters.” Others argue that reminding voters of a 2024 campaign that went sour isn’t the best strategy for a party that is grasping for a message and searching for new, younger leaders.A CNN pollthis month asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents which leader best reflects the party’s core values. Only 1% chose Biden. What’s more, the wounds of 2024 are still fresh, with many Democrats aggrieved over Biden’s decision to run again and remain in the race until just a few months before the election, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris little time to organize a campaign of her own. Alan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Philadelphia, said in an interview: “There are plenty of people in the Democratic Party who were obviously very frustrated with how things played out last year, but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden."" At the “appropriate time,” Biden can be an asset to the party by campaigning in selected areas, such as his hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, but now isn’t it, Kessler added. “It’s time to move on with new leadership,” he said. Biden has no pangs of regret, a person familiar with his private conversations said. He remains defiant and believes Trump’s victory shows the party did itself no favors by pushing him to drop out of the race, the source said. One person in particular seems eager to see Biden return to the political stage: Trump. The new president has used his massive following to ensure that Americans don’t soon forget the old one. Trump has publicly mentioned Biden, Biden family members or the Biden administration an average of seven times a day since the start of his second term, according to an NBC News review of his remarks, interviews and social media posts. Overall, Trump has invoked his predecessor in some form more than 400 times since the inauguration on Jan. 20. In most instances — more than 325 — Trump has mentioned Biden alone. In about 75 cases, Trump has mentioned Biden family members or the Biden administration. The context in which Trump brings up his predecessor often involves immigration, inflation, elections or foreign wars, as well as issues involving the Justice Department. Speaking at the Justice Department last week, Trump questioned Biden’s use of an autopen to sign documents, calling it “disrespectful to the office” and ""maybe not even valid."" The Justice Department blessed the use of an autopen in a memo in 2005, and the Constitution carries no requirement that the president sign documents by his own hand. Vice President JD Vance also uses Biden as a foil. At a tech summit this week, Vance took time in his speech to take a swipe at Biden’s mental acuity — an issue that dogged the former president throughout the campaign. “In defense of Joe Biden, he was asleep most of the time. I don’t think he totally realized what he was doing,” Vance said. Asked why Trump speaks about Biden so frequently, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “We still very much are fixing so many of the problems created or started by the Biden administration. It’s important to remind the American people and media why these problems exist."" A defense that Trump supporters use in rationalizing his attacks on perceived political foes is that he’s a “counterpuncher.” But here, Biden has already left the ring. He hasn’t thrown any public punches since Trump escorted him to the helicopter on Inauguration Day for his departure from the U.S. Capitol grounds. Indeed, Biden’s first speaking event since he left office came last week with no fanfare whatsoever. He appeared in New York City for a conference of the National High School Model United Nations in Manhattan. Six months after having spoken before the actual U.N. for his last time as president, Biden gave a speech to its high school facsimile in a hotel ballroom. He also took questions and posed for pictures with students. “He asked me about my future, and I told him how much he inspired me to go into the field of politics,” said Suzy Radzinski, 18, a senior at Brighton High School in Utah, who met Biden on the photo line. A Facebook videofrom the event showed a group of excited students waving to Biden. “I met you on your book tour!” one shouted to him as he stood onstage in a suit and tie. “All right!” said Biden, prompting appreciative laugher. Inside Biden’s close-knit circle, advisers have concluded that it’s not wise for him to respond publicly to every insult or accusation Trump throws his way. Doing so would personalize the issue, turning it into a contest between Trump and Biden, as opposed to keeping the focus on whether Trump is being truthful or not. Biden’s approach for now is to let surrogates respond to Trump’s broadsides. Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist, said that’s the right posture. “It makes no sense for Joe Biden to respond to Donald Trump,” she said in an interview. “The American people are not looking backward; they’re looking forward.” Rather than take the attacks personally, Jill Biden has found a new role for herself: soothing those who are unnerved by the tumult in Washington, the person close to her said. “She is finding herself comforting people. More and more, as she’s out and about, people come up to her who are looking for reassurance,"" the person said. Peter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News. Carol E.

www.nbcnews.com,Victims of 'romance scams' turn to Congress for help,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/victims-romance-scams-turn-congress-help-rcna197052,"WASHINGTON — Four years after getting divorced, Beth Hyland, 54, decided it was finally time to start dating again. She had never used dating apps, but her work colleagues had found luck meeting significant others online. “So, I thought I’d try it,” Hyland told NBC News in an interview this month. Eventually, she met someone who appeared to be her perfect match: “Richard,” who claimed to be a French project manager for a construction company, began texting and talking on the phone constantly with Hyland. But “Richard” wasn’t who he said he was. Hyland just didn’t know it yet — and her story, and hundreds like it, would soon inspire federal legislation in Congress. Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., have introduced a bill that would require dating apps and social media companies to remove or flag scammers from their platforms and issue notifications to users who interact with those accounts. At a mark-up of the bill earlier this month, Blackburn introduced Hyland, who was seated in the Senate Commerce Committee hearing room in the Capitol: “I do want to recognize Beth Hyland,” Blackburn said. “She is a survivor of this crime. She drove nine hours to be here in the audience with us today.” One month into her relationship with “Richard,” Hyland was so in love that she didn’t think twice when asked for financial help. “We professed our undying love for each other,” she said. “They call it love bombing, where they just constantly bombard you with compliments and terms of endearment.” She thought she had met “the one,” and “Richard” even proposed to her. Hyland started looking at houses for them in her hometown of Portage, Michigan, and sent photos of engagement rings in preparation for their eventual nuptials. But it wasn’t a fairy tale ending for Hyland. “Richard” told her he had to go to Qatar for a construction project, and he was expecting to share with Hyland the “huge” payout he’d get for it. But in the meantime, he said his bank account was locked. “Why wouldn’t I help my fiancé if I knew the money was coming back?” Hyland said. Soon after his request, she took out loans for $26,000 and transferred the money to “Richard” using bitcoin. That was when “Richard” told her there would be a $50,000 activation fee to get the money into his account. That was when Hyland started to feel reluctant about sending “Richard” money, so she contacted her trusted financial adviser. “Something told me to tell him the whole story,” Hyland said, and she did. She recalled her financial adviser telling her, “Beth, I hate to be the one to tell you this, I think you’re in a romance scam.” At first, Hyland couldn’t believe it. “It shattered the future, the dreams that we had,” she said. After a week, Hyland decided to cut him off. “He kept trying to come back, saying, ‘How could you accuse me of this? How could you?’” Hyland said. She recalled that “Richard” even threatened suicide on the phone in an attempt to win her back. “But I’m like, ‘No, this is done. I’ve got to move forward,’” she told NBC News in the Capitol. “Richard” ended up being a Nigerian scammer, part of a group known as the “Yahoo boys” — one of many criminal organizations that has scammed victims out ofbillions of dollars.Law enforcement was never able to catch Hyland’s scammer, and she said they didn’t take her seriously, either. Hyland said she felt embarrassed and stupid for being scammed, but her financial adviser assured her that, unfortunately, people are scammed on dating apps more than she could imagine. “In the physical world, there are laws against this,"" Blackburn told NBC News in an interview. ""They have not been applied to the virtual space, and most people realize it is past time to put some protections in place on the virtual space.” The legislation passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee last week on a bipartisan basis, but bills that crack down on big tech often get slow-walked in Congress. Blackburn, who has been leading the charge on advocating for more regulations on tech, also cowrote the Kids Online Safety Act with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. That bill would require social media companies to better protect minors online and provide guardians with more control of their children’s use of platforms. Itpassed the Senateeasily last July, 91-3, but then stalled in the Republican-controlled House. “They should be making their platforms safe, just as in the physical space we make the public square safe, but they are choosing not to,” Blackburn said of social media companies. “The social media companies have proven through the years that they will not do this on their own. … Their lack of desire to protect individuals on their platforms is disgusting.” April Helm, a journalist based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has dedicated her life to spreading awareness about romance scams and helping victims after her 70-year-old mother was scammed out of $350,000. After her mother met a much younger man online, Helm knew something was off with the new love interest. “She said she’d be careful, but within two or three weeks, she got a picture from a young man about 40 years old, really attractive, and she said she met someone online. And I could tell that it was a scam instantly.” Helm said in an interview. Helm said that her mother, a widow and recent cancer survivor, ended up losing her house, her car and eventually her life as a result of the scam. “Scammers try to keep you delirious, because that helps you with your thinking,"" Helm said. ""You’re not thinking clearly, and you make bad decisions. I think that he had kept her up for so long, for so many nights, that she was exhausted and she rolled out of bed and that’s how she broke her neck."" Since her mom’s death, Helm started a podcast dedicated to telling “scammer stories,” sharing accounts from hundreds of victims and their family members and using real-world stories to inform her listeners of red flags to look for when dating online. Helm said that scammers on dating websites will often try to get victims off the app they're on as fast as possible and get them on one like WhatsApp, which she said isn’t tracked as much. Once done, ""the quicker they can start asking you for money and grooming you,"" Helm said. Scammers will also ask their victims a lot of questions to learn about their lives. Helm said too many personal questions too soon can be a sign you’re speaking with a scammer. “No man, in real life, is that interested in your life,” she joked. While there are resources to help prevent romance scams, Helm is skeptical that Congress will be able pass any laws that actually stop them. “They need to come up with more speed bumps, but that will just slow them down. They’ll find workarounds,” she said. Like Helm, Hyland said it’s critical for victims of romance scams to speak out. “I remember just bawling on the floor in utter despair, sobbing,” Hyland said. “But I made a decision right away. I said, ‘I’m not gonna let this destroy me. This is gonna hurt. I need to deal with the emotions,’” she said. “‘I’m gonna advocate. I’m gonna fight for victims.’” Kate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News’ Capitol Hill team. Julie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.",2025-03-22 00:48:20

""I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information."" Representatives for Harris and Clinton did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday night.

It also applies to any members of the Biden family. Many of the people in Trump's memo already had their clearances revokedthis monthby Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The State Departmentindicated in 2018that Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, had her security clearance withdrawn that year, at her request. It’s unclear if her clearance was later reinstated. Trump in February said he was cutting off former President Joe Biden's access to intelligence information.

www.nbcnews.com,Trump says student loans will be handled by Small Business Administration,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-says-student-loans-will-handled-small-business-administration-rcna197564,"PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Friday that theSmall Business Administration, instead of theU.S. Department of Education, would handle the country’sfederal student loan portfolio. “We havea portfolio that is very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal,” Trump said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. “That’s coming out of the Department of Education immediately.” “They’re all set for it,” the president said of the SBA. “They’re waiting for it.” Outstandingfederal education debtexceeds $1.6 trillion, with more than 40 million Americans holding student loans. Trump’s announcement comes a day after hesigned an executive orderaimed at dismantling the Education Department. Only Congress can unilaterally eliminate the agency. Consumer advocates are worried that the mass transfer of accounts could trigger errors, or compromise borrowers’ privacy. They also raised concerns about how a change in agency might affect protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Trump said earlier this month that his administration was looking to task any of the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or the Small Business Administration with federal student loan management. Experts said the most logical agency would have been the Treasury Department since it already plays a role in collecting past-due debts from Americans through the Treasury Offset Program. Meanwhile, “neither Commerce nor SBA has any relevant experience,” higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC this month. One important thing for borrowers to keep in mind: The terms and conditions of your federal student loans cannot change even if the agency overseeing them does, experts say.

www.nbcnews.com,Trump administration launching an AI tool for government use,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-launching-ai-tool-government-use-rcna197525,"The General Services Administration is launching a new artificial intelligence tool for government use, designed to support staff at the agency in their regular, daily work, with the goal of rolling it out to other federal agencies in the near future. GSA began building the technology 18 months ago under the Biden administration, focusing on the security and privacy of the AI tool, a GSA spokesperson tells NBC News. The decision to develop the tool internally was driven by concerns within the department about the risks of using commercially available AI tools, according to a GSA official familiar with the development of the tool. The tool was ultimately built internally to ensure it meets government security requirements. GSA is working to see how the AI tool fits into the daily workflow of federal works and is encouraging — but not requiring — staff to use the tool, according to the official. ""The opportunity to incorporate generative AI into Government work is akin to giving a personal computer to every worker,” GSA’s Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator Stephen Ehikian touted the new tool, in a release, saying, “We are just at the start of our journey using this new tool, but the demand for this technology exists across GSA and the broader government.” The Trump administration has been supportive of the self-developed AI tool, the spokesperson tells NBC, noting that while the tool is still in its early stages, the rollout within GSA will allow the government to get the feedback necessary to make adjustments that will improve the functionality and how quickly it can be delivered to other agencies. Tech mogul Elon Musk, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, has pledged to make the government more efficient in part by embracing AI. Musk's Department of Government Efficiencyhad been expected to use an AI tool to evaluate answers toan emailsent to federal workers asking them to justify their positions, three sources with knowledge of the system told NBC News. Musk at the timedenied in a post on Xthat an AI tool was evaluating the answers. ""This was basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email,"" he said.

www.nbcnews.com,When bird flu ravages a farm,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-kakadoodle-farm-eggs-rcna196879,"Stray feathers litter the ground inside the empty coop at Kakadoodle Farm. A few beige eggshells crunch underfoot. No hens were left alive. MATTESON, Ill. — This is what bird flu looks like. The coop is empty and cavernous, the air still heavy with the stench of chicken waste. On the floor, wood chip bedding has soaked up most of the blood from the birds slaughtered to prevent further spread of infection. Stray feathers litter the ground. A few remnants of beige eggshells crunch underfoot. There used to be 3,000 hens on Kakadoodle Farm — scratching, pecking, following the farmworkers around. Creating a din so loud you could barely hear someone yell from the other end of the coop. Now there are none. It’s a scene that keeps repeating itself, again and again, on poultry farms large and small across America. The biggest avian influenza outbreak in U.S. history is taking a brutal toll. Birds are dying off — or they're slaughtered — by the thousands. Farms are suffering massive financial losses, compounded in some cases by federal funding cuts andfreezes. The outbreak has driven retail egg prices to arecord highlast month of $5.90 a dozen on average, nearly double what they were a year earlier. They have reached$12 a dozenin some places. No one else, human or animal, has come down with bird flu at Kakadoodle since the virus hit. But a large part of the farm — “the dirty zone” — is now under quarantine. And it will be for months to come. At first, they thoughtit was the cold. It was early January, and temperatures in southern Illinois were plunging into the single digits; the water lines running to the farm’s three coops kept freezing over. So when the workers told Kakadoodle Farm owner Marty Thomas about the birds, he first thought they must have frozen to death. About 30 were scattered across the floors of two coops. At the time, Marty didn’t think too much of it. “Let’s make sure we keep an eye on the water — make sure it’s flowing,” he told them. The next day,as he headed down to the coops, he saw one of his farmworkers walking out with her arms full of dead chickens. “Oh, my God,” he said, rushing toward her. A hundred more had died overnight. They began piling the bodies outside in the snow. Most lay dead on the coop floor. A few had died inside the red nesting boxes with their heads sticking out. Some were still alive, but just barely — they were listless, stirring only when they were picked up, too weak to stand or walk. Marty was mystified about what was ailing his birds. But he knew what he had to do with the ones that weren’t going to make it. He picked up an ax from the shed and asked his wife to come out back to help. Kakadoodle Farm sitson the edge of a busy road about 45 minutes from the southern end of Chicago. It has been a working farm for nearly 200 years, but Marty and MariKate took it over just recently, in late 2023, to grow the burgeoning egg business they’d been running out of their small, 5-acre homestead. They inherited two existing coops and built a third, adding chickens and giving their birds access to grassy pasture and a non-genetically modified feed. Kakadoodle eggs are a specialty product; most commercial eggs come from large-scale producers, and most of the national flock isn’t pasture-raised. Their goal: To produce healthier chickens and more nutritious, better-tasting eggs that crack open to reveal happy, bright orange yolks. They also launched an online farmers market to deliver local produce, meat and grocery items directly to customers. It was a small, fledging business, with just seven part-time employees. But the couple were already drawing up plans to create new grazing areas for sheep and livestock in the fallow fields that stretched toward the train tracks. They didn’t have any experience with farming; he was a software entrepreneur, and she was an ER nurse. It was a wild dream they’d chased after Marty survived Stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He’d gone through months of chemotherapy, lost his hair, prayed — and was declared cancer-free by the end of 2018. But Marty couldn’t stop wondering how he’d gotten sick in the first place and kept coming back to the chemicals in the food he ate, the pesticides sprayed over the land. He stared at the raw eggs that he cracked into a bowl for the kids every morning and realized he’d never given a thought to where they’d come from or why they were so cheap. They started with eight birds. Pretty soon the chickens started laying more eggs than their four kids could eat. Marty created a website where you could arrange for home delivery, inviting local friends and relatives to place orders. They bought more chickens. Which meant more eggs. Which started overflowing in the kitchen sink, where they were washing all of them by hand. Then, driving toward the interstate, they saw it: a sprawling 74-acre property for sale, just a short distance from their home. Their dream could grow far bigger. In January 2022, thefirst wild birds in the United Statestested positivefor a highly contagious and deadly strain of bird flu. The next month, it hadspread to a turkey farmin Indiana. By April, the country’sfirst human casewas found in Colorado. The outbreak picked up steam last year, jumping todairy cattlefor the first time in history while continuing to rip through poultry farms across the United States — both small, pasture-raised producers like Kakadoodle andmassive operationsthat pack thousands of chickens together indoors. Bird flu has now affected 167 million birds across the United States, and it’s also spreading to cats,rats, tigers and seals, among other species. The risk to humansremains low, with one death and 70 known cases, most involving people who had been in close contact with infected animals. But the rampant spread of the virus increases the likelihood that it could mutate into a version that’s far more dangerous to humans and can be passed easily between them,creating another pandemic. And for domestic birds like chickens — which contract the virus through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces — the virus has amortality rateof nearly 100%. The USDA, along with some animal health officials, hasadvised limiting outdoor accessfor poultry given the risk from wild birds — but the virus is also striking farms where birds are only kept indoors. While some birds may display symptoms,the USDAsays, others can die suddenly without any warning. Bird flu is “is a devastating disease for large and small flock owners alike,” the USDA said in a statement, pointing to the agency’srecent effortsto help poultry farms affected by the outbreak “USDA is committed to exploring additional ways to aid flock owners and minimize their financial burdens.

But he said some farmers never reported it, because they didn’t want the USDA to come in, shut down and quarantine their operations. MariKate had worried about the wild birds that flitted around the pastures where the chickens roamed and pecked at their feed, knowing they could transmit the virus. But it was impossible to completely isolate their flock. “There are things you can’t control,” Marty told her. As he picked up one dead chicken after another, Marty didn’t immediately think it was bird flu, he said. So many were dying, but without the obvious symptoms of the virus — difficulty breathing, nasal discharge or low egg production. And at first, the veterinarian agreed: It was probably the freezing weather that had done in the birds. The vet pointed out that the newest, most modern coop hadn’t been hit and advised Marty and MariKate to keep the birds comfortable. They all hustled to bring in more bedding and heaters. Driving home, Marty felt assured that his flock was in good shape. “These birds look great,” he remembers thinking. “They’re scratching; they’re laying eggs. They seem perfectly healthy.” Within two days, there were dead chickens inside every coop. The vet realized it might be worse than they all thought, the Thomases said — and let them know he was notifying the state Agriculture Department. Shortly after, MariKate got a call directly from the USDA, which wanted to visit the farm immediately — and asked her to collect the bodies of three dead birds for testing. By the time the federal veterinarians showed up in their hazmat suits, less than a week after the first chickens had fallen, nearly 2,500 birds were dead. There were splatters of blood in the snow where Marty and MariKate had killed the ailing birds, which flop around when their heads are severed, and an ashy pit where they’d burned some of the carcasses. Only 500 were still alive. MariKate steadied one in her arms as the vet approached, it cawed as the vet stuck a long swab down its throat. Just a few hours later, she got the call: Their chickens had come back positive for bird flu. The USDA was coming back the next morning to slaughter the rest inside the coop — a standard procedure known as “depopulation.” The Thomases didn’t have to be there if they didn’t want to. They didn’t want to be there. After it was all over, farmworker Joline Lyons was the first to open the coop door. She walked inside, then immediately walked back out, her face pale. “There’s a lot of blood and a lot of heads over here,” Lyons recalled telling the Thomases. The USDA had gassed the 500 remaining chickens with carbon dioxide to stun them, then decapitated them. The body parts were scattered throughout the coop, with blood streaked on nesting boxes and roosting bars. The farmers were left to clean up the mess. Marty worried whether he’d have a business left to run — and what on Earth their customers would think. Anyone driving by the farm that day would have been able to spot the white hazmat suits and wonder what the hell was going on. He and his wife agreed: They had to tell their customers. They had to tell everyone. The whole point of their farm was for people to understand where their food was coming from, what was going into it and how it came to be. This was part of that, too. “Important Message from Kakadoodle,” they wrote. “This week our chickens started dying without any symptoms ...” After some hesitation, they also set up a GoFundMe campaign. The USDAcompensates farmersonly for the birds that are alive when it gets there and dead when it leaves — not the ones that have already died from bird flu. The Thomases will get $5 a bird from the USDA, they said, which means $2,500 in total. It doesn’t come close to the $100,000 in egg revenue Kakadoodle will lose by the time the mandatory 120-day quarantine is over in June, when they can have chickens on the farm again. Ifthey can get chickens on the farm again. The loss ofmore than 1,600 flocksin every state since 2022 has meant a nationwide run on egg-laying chickens. The farm is also being squeezed by the broader cuts to federal funds: In October, it was greenlit for a $220,000 grant to transform an old barn into a distribution center for their online marketplace, pending USDA approval. The Thomases spent $80,000 on renovations — pouring a concrete floor, putting in insulation — fully expecting to be reimbursed. But the Trump administration has sincecut funding for the program. MariKate keeps thinking about what their pastor said in church, just a week before their birds started dying. “There’s two kinds of people in life,” she said. “You can either say ‘why me?’ or ‘what’s next?’” They dug the graveson the edge of the farm, in a field dotted with dried corncobs. The four of them went out together: Marty, MariKate and two farmworkers. It took them all day to dig the holes, then cart over all the chicken carcasses in a skid steer. They buried all the bodies, along with thousands of dollars of feed and eggs, as the USDA had instructed them to do. MariKate wept inside her N-95 mask. That day, a car had pulled up to the farm, and one of their regular customers got out, hoping to pick up fresh eggs. Still dressed in her hazmat suit, MariKate explained what had happened. He immediately handed her all the cash in his wallet. Then the messages started pouring in. “Praying for you guys in this time of struggle.” “All your dental friends are rooting for this to be all fixed up as quickly as possible!!” Donations to their GoFundMe campaign have swelled since word got out — as have orders for their online farmers market, the main source of their remaining revenue. They've been moved by the outpouring of support from their customers and community. But Kakadoodle Farm is still in financial peril. They’re considering applying for a private loan to keep the farm afloat. “We’re at the bottom of our barrel,” Marty said. “If this doesn’t work, we’re out our entire life savings.” What they keep telling themselves: They’ve weathered other disasters on the farm  — and somehow found a way to survive. There was the barn that burned down because of a faulty extension cord. The bacterial infection that tore through their flock, cratering egg production. There were endless mishaps and mistakes they made as they expanded their operation, battling mites and frozen water lines and the aftermath of tornados, scouring YouTube and turning to more seasoned farmers for answers. “It’s happened again and again and again,” Marty said. “This is crazy, what we’re doing. Like — we don’t know this world at all.” And the next time, he and MariKate will be better prepared. They want to renovate their coops to keep wild birds out of the feed, while still giving the chickens space to roam. They’ll make sure to keep their farm shoes on the farm, to help reduce the spread of disease. Because bird flu isn’t leaving America any time soon. Just three weeks ago, Marty and MariKate got a call from another local farmer who suspected he had a bird flu outbreak. He agonized over whether to call the USDA. His father begged him not to, warning that the agency would come and slaughter all of their birds. “All I can tell you is what we did,” MariKate told him before she hung up. The farmer made the call.

www.nbcnews.com,Targeted for deportation,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/scholars-targeted-deportation-trump-administration-rcna197331,"Agraduate student from Indiawith a student visa who had been teaching at Georgetown University. A professor at Brown University’s medical schoolwho also has a valid visa and hails from Lebanon. A pro-Palestinian activist with a green card who recentlygraduated from Columbia Universityand has a baby on the way with his U.S. citizen wife. All three scholars have been targeted by the Trump administration for deportation this month despite the fact that they all have papers allowing them to live and work in the U.S. In each case, the Department of Homeland Security has justified its decision to kick them out of the country by citing an obscure provision in immigration law thatdates to the Cold Warand gives the secretary of state the authority to deport that person. “The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,”reads a document in one of the deportation cases, citingthe provision. Back in 1952, when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, the aim was to keep Communists out of America. Now, the provision has become yet another legal weapon the Trump administration is deploying to fulfill its mandate to deport millions of migrants, experts said. And it's a potentially potent weapon, Gabriel J. Chin, a professor of law at UC Davis, wrotein a recent pieceon the rights of green card holders that attempted to answer the question of whether the Trump administration could legally deport Khalil. ""While lawful permanent residents may not be criminally prosecuted for their political speech or activity, what they say or write may well affect their ability to remain in the U.S., if the government determines that they are a security risk,"" Chin wrote. Until now, Homeland Security officials have mostly targeted the legions of desperate migrantswho crossed into the countryvia the U.S.-Mexico border and who have claimed asylum but have no firm legal status in the U.S. But the deportation of Brown University’s Dr. Rasha Alawieh to Lebanon and the detentions of Georgetown University’s Badar Khan Suri and Columbia University’s Mahmoud Khalil are signaling that the Trump administration also has in its crosshairs — and may be trying to make examples of — accomplished academics who may not be on the same page as the government when it comes to foreign policy. ""There is no question that this is an attempt by Trump and his administration to chill the speech of academics, particularly those who are not U.S. citizens, that he does not agree with,"" Chin told NBC News. ""This is a new era."" That appears to be the case with Khalil, 30. An Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, Khalil is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. But he became a target of the Trump administration when he became the unmasked face of pro-Palestinian studentdemonstrationsthat roiled Columbia last year. Immigration agents arrested Khalil in front of his wife, Noor Abdalla, on March 8 in New York City and briefly took him to a detention center in New Jersey before transferring him to a facility in Louisiana. He has not been charged with a crime; Homeland Security officials said he was targeted becausehe ""led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.” On Monday, a federal judge barred the government from deporting Khalil and ordered that his case be moved to New Jersey. Khalil,in a letterhe dictated over the phone to his family, said he was a “political prisoner” who was “targeted” for advocating for the Palestinian cause. At least one other student at theIvy League school was detained by immigrationofficials following the protests. Suri, who is believed to be 41, was detained on Monday by masked DHS agents as he was returning to the Virginia home he shares with his wife, Mapheze Saleh, and their three children. The detention  wasfirst reported by Politico. Georgetown saidit was not awareof Suri engaging in any “illegal activity,” and neither the DHS nor the State Department responded to questions from NBC on why Suri was taken into custody. But Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said on X, in response to the Politico story, that Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” McLaughlin also alleged that “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.” ""He was simply commenting on the Israel-Palestine war, as many people do in this country, many people have opinions on it. He has a right to speak about political change,"" said Sophia Gregg, an attorney for ACLU of Virginia who represents Suri. ""There has been no allegation that he’s ever advocated for violence."" Gregg also said this matter isn't about ""some sort of familial relations with somebody,"" instead ""he’s being targeted for his political speech and that is something that cannot be tolerated in this country."" Suri, as of Wednesday, was being held atadetention centerin Alexandria, Louisiana. His attorneys on Thursday asked a federal court to compel the government to return him to Virginia, suggesting that he was rounded up on the basis of his speech on Palestinian rights and that that violated the due process clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. “Dr. Suri’s experience is shocking and disgraceful,” said Suri’s immigration attorney, Hassan Ahmad. “It should worry everyone that masked government agents can disappear someone from their home and family because the current administration dislikes their opinion.” A judge ordered Suri not to be deported “unless and until” the court changes its position. Alawieh, a 34-year-old Lebanese citizen with a valid H-1B visa, was sent back to her homeland after she told customs agents at Boston Logan International Airport that shehad attended the funeralof Hassan Nasrallah, the leader in Iran-back Hezbollah, the DHS said in a statement Monday. When asked if she supported Nasrallah, Alawieh said as a Shia Muslim she did but “from a religious perspective.” “A visa is a privilege not a right — glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” the agency responded later. If Alawieh did attend the Nasrallah funeral, she had plenty of company. Tens of thousands of people gathered at the 48,000-capacity Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut. But Alawieh, a kidney and transplant specialist who had been in the U.S. since 2018, was deported despite an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts that she should not be removed from the state without 48 hours’ notice to “give the Court time to consider the matter.” “We’re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the U.S. to see her patients, and we’re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,"" Alawieh's immigration lawyer, Stephanie Marzouk,told reporters Monday. Rep. Gabe Amo, D-R.I., said his office has been working since Friday to “assess the facts surrounding Dr. Alawieh, including the apparent violation of a federal judge’s order.” Meanwhile, Alawieh’s colleagues at Brown’s division of nephrology in East Providence, Rhode Island, were trying to square the person they worked with with the DHS statement. “She’s a very nice person,” Dr. George Bayliss said.

www.nbcnews.com,The anti-vaxxer playbook,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-vaccine-influencers-weaponized-measles-death-texas-rcna196900,"In February, a 6-year-old Texan wasthe first childin the United States to die of measles in two decades. Her death might have beena warningto an increasingly vaccine-hesitant country about the consequences of shunning the only guaranteed way to fight the preventable disease. Instead, the anti-vaccine movement is broadcasting a different lesson, turning the girl and her family into propaganda, an emotional plank in the misguided argument that vaccines are more dangerous than the illnesses they prevent. The child’s grieving parents have given just one on-camera interview, to Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded and led until recently by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary. In avideo that aired onlineMonday, the young parents stifled sobs, recalling how their unvaccinated daughter got sick from measles, then pneumonia, how she was hospitalized and put on a ventilator, and how she died. The couple, who are Mennonites, believe their daughter’s death was the will of God. When Children’s Health Defense’s director of programming, Polly Tommey, asked specifically about parents who heard their story and might be “rushing out, panicking,” to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the parents rebuked the intervention that offered the best chance of preventing their daughter’s death. “Don’t do the shots,” the girl’s mother said. Measles, she added, is “not as bad as they’re making it out to be.” She noted that her four other children all recovered after having received alternative treatments from an anti-vaccine doctor, including cod liver oil, a source of vitamin A, and budesonide, an inhaled steroid usually used for asthma. “Also, the measles are good for the body,” the girl’s father said, adding through an interpreter of Low German that measles boosts the immune system and wards against cancer — an untrue supposition often offered by anti-vaccine groups andrepeated recently by Kennedy. Without evidence, influencers at Children’s Health Defense and beyond have reframed the tragedy of the girl’s death as proof — of the efficacy of unproven cures like vitamin A, of maltreatment by a hospital and even of a plot to undermine Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services. It’s a familiar playbook, following countless videos Children’s Health Defense has produced before this one. Along withsince-discredited science, the modern anti-vaccine movement was built on the personal accounts of parents — collected through websites,bus toursandanti-vaccine documentaries— who claimed vaccines harmed their children. And even as experts point to overwhelmingdata on vaccine safety, theraw and immediate accounts— delivered straight to the movement’s followers — provide a narrative that public health officials, bound by evidence and constrained by institutional caution, struggle to counter. “It was a savvy way of centering a mother’s intuition, a mother’s insight, which is very sacred in our culture,” said Karen Ernst, director of the nonprofit group Voices for Vaccines. “That was paramount to how they built the movement.” “The problem is, a simple story told quickly is so much easier to believe than a nuanced, well-sourced truth told later,” Ernst added. “In that way, public health is always chasing the anti-vaccine movement around. They’re never getting ahead of it.” Representatives for the family and Children’s Health Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ainsley Nelson, a spokesperson for Covenant Children’s Hospital, which treated the child, said in a statement that the hospital could not comment on the case because of patient confidentiality laws but that “misleading and inaccurate claims” were circulating online. “What we can say is that our physicians and care teams follow evidence-based protocols and make clinical decisions based on a patient’s evolving condition, diagnostic findings, and the best available medical knowledge,” Nelson said. HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard responded witha linkto a recent op-ed on the Fox News website, in which Kennedy wrote, “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.” Measles has spread largely unchecked through the Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, sickening more than 190 people, most of them small children, and reaching into neighboring areas. The actual number of people who have fallen ill has been underreported, officials say, because of inadequate testing. For most children, measles brings a fever and an itchy rash, but it can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures and brain damage.Out of every 1,000 cases, about 200 children require hospitalization, 50 develop pneumonia, one experiences brain swelling that can result in disability, and one to three will die. In Gaines County, hundreds of parents have lined up for amakeshift warehouse clinic run by Dr. Ben Edwards, an alternative practitioner from Lubbock who treats children with an unproven protocol of cod liver oil and budesonide. Edwards had not treated the 6-year-old who died, but afterward, he treated the couple’s remaining children at their sibling’s wake. “Dr. Edwards was there for us,” the mother said. Edwards said in an email that he treated many children with “the appropriate standard of care” and that he had been in contact with state and federal health authorities. Despite the urgency of the measles crisis, the official response from medical groups has been typically restrained. Ina statement Tuesday, a coalition of 34 scientific and medical organizations, including the American Association of Immunologists, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, reiterated their support for vaccines as “a cornerstone of public health, a shining example of the power of scientific research, and a vital tool in the fight against preventable diseases.” In a media landscape in which misinformation spreads faster than institutional statements, it’s unlikely to be enough. “We can provide information to other people and just say this is what the data show, but it might take some people with high charisma to help deliver those messages,” said Stephen Jameson, president of the American Association of Immunologists. “But it is hard, because if a vaccine is preventative, where is the rescue of somebody? How do you tell the story ‘Child does not get disease’?” In this environment, Kennedy plays a key public role at the helm of HHS, a platform he has already used to spread falsehoods about measles, the MMR vaccine and the outbreak in Texas. In an interview withFox Nation, Kennedyclaimed falselythat measles immunity came with protections against cancer and heart disease, that cod liver oil and steroids had provided “miraculous” treatment for measles cases in Texas and that measles was a threat only to unhealthy children, suggesting that malnutrition “may have been an issue"" with the girl who died. Inanother Fox News interview, Kennedy saidwithout evidencethat the MMR vaccine causes deaths every year. “Misinformation is really leading the day,” said Kris Ehresmann, the recently retired director of the Minnesota Health Department’s infectious disease division. “It’s gone from a parent trying to assess the best decision for their child to a hostile movement that I didn’t see in the early days of my career.” “Covid politicized vaccines and science, really,” Ehresmann added. “And that gave the anti-vaxxer folks a huge foothold.” Patsy Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner, has seen how the uncontrolled spread of an illness can change parents’ minds — with the right messaging. She recalls going “mosque to mosque to mosque” during a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota to listen to the Somali community’s concerns and educate local religious leaders about the danger of measles and the safety of the MMR vaccine. She spoke to nearly every parent of the children hospitalized in the outbreak. “Many of them, the parents, were like, ‘Oh, my God, I never knew it would be this bad. Why didn’t I know this?’” said Stinchfield, who later served as president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The No. 1 thing I heard was regret — like, ‘Why didn’t I vaccinate?’” Those stories have yet to be publicly shared by parents of children sickened in the West Texas outbreak. Last week, anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree dedicated a segment of his internet show, “The HighWire,” to interviewing Texas mothers whose unvaccinated children contracted and survived measles. As the parents described standing by their choice not to vaccinate, photos of one child, who had to be medevaced to a Lubbock hospital, filled the screen. The girl was lying in a hospital bed, her eyes glazed, connected to lines and tubes. After years of arguing measles was no threat to healthy U.S. children, Bigtree was visibly taken aback and searched for an explanation — perhaps measles had mutated to become more serious, he suggested. “That little girl is very sick,” he said.

www.nbcnews.com,Fear at isolated Antarctica base as a man   allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/antarctica-base-man-accused-attacking-colleague-rcna197517,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolatedAntarcticabase was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said. The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa’s Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats. The email pleaded for help. “His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat. South Africa’s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said. “The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified. The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June. The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa. The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town. Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base. The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified. “It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said. Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa’s remote research baseson Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica. In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague’s room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa’s Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions. The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that overseesthe U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they’dexperienced harassment or assaultwhile on research trips in Antarctica.

www.nbcnews.com,"It's a dirty job, but Ukraine's women are doing it for the war effort",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-women-coal-mines-energy-ceasefire-zelenskyy-rcna197219,"PAVLOHRAD, Ukraine — They are Ukraine’s“Rosie the Riveters,”rolling up their sleeves and doing a dirty job once considered suitable only for men. But unlike their American equivalents inWorld War II, they’re not working in defense-industry factories. Instead they’re going 900 feet underground, helping to dig coal and keep the power on, replacing themen who left to fight Russia. Now they’re hopeful thatPresident Donald Trumpcan secure a ceasefire deal and bring an end to the war, which entered its fourth year in February. “We really wanted to help and to replace those men who went to fight and to protect Ukraine,” Nadiya Moskalenko told NBC News on Thursday. The 48-year-old grandmother said two of her sons had volunteered to fight Russia, and a few months afterPresident Vladimir Putinlaunched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, she signed up to go down the 50-year-old mine on the outskirts of the city of Pavlohrad in eastern Ukraine. Before the war started, the government barred women from doing jobs underground because it considered the work too physically demanding. But after many male miners joined the military early in the war and others were later conscripted, the Soviet-era policy was scrapped. Moskalenko, who wears lipstick and eyeliner to work, operates the cable cars that move workers and supplies across the mine’s vast 75-mile tunnel network. It was not “hard physically, but it’s a very responsible job,” she said, adding that she has to “react quickly” if anything goes wrong. “You can’t miss anything and [have] to be very attentive and responsible.” At her mine alone, 700 of the 3,000 male workers went off to fight, according to Alyona Lapina, a communications manager at DTEK, the mine’s owner and Ukraine’s largest private energy firm. She added that 71 had been killed and 200 were wounded. The mine is near the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. Since then, the Donbas, which is made up of the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, has been used as a staging post for Russian attacks into Ukraine. Putin illegally annexed them in September 2022 along with the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Ukrainian forces are still fighting to regain control of all four territories. Elevator operator Iryna Basanets, 38, said she also joined up after the war began. Since then, she said, the women and men had learned to work together. “The boys help us,” she said. “We are sweeping here, cleaning, keeping our working space clean and tidy.” But war is always close, with an air raid siren sounding shortly after miners returned to the surface for lunch on Thursday. The coal they mine is used primarily to power Ukrainian electricity and heating stations, key energy infrastructure that has come under frequent Russian attacks and is now the subject of a proposed temporary ceasefire accepted by Ukraine and partially agreed to by Putin. Previous Russian attacks on energy infrastructure like power stations and substations had led to blackouts, Basanets said, leaving miners underground with no electricity or cellphone signal, though they were eventually brought back to the surface. “We always store water in advance,” she said, adding that some blackouts are scheduled. Both Basanets and Moskalenko said they were hopeful that Trump’s recent talks with both Putin and UkrainianPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyycould lead to a peace agreement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz said that in a phone call with Trump on Wednesday, Zelenskyy agreed to move forward with “a partial ceasefire against energy,” according to a joint White House statement. Zelenskyy later confirmed in a lengthy post on X that Ukraine was ready to implement this deal. Their call came a day after Trump spoke with Putin, who declined to endorse a 30-day ceasefire that was accepted byZelenskyy. But, according to aKremlin readoutof their conversation Tuesday, the Russian leader did agree “to mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days.” “We want this to happen,” Moskalenko said of the peace agreement. “And when you really want something, then you hope and you believe that it will happen.” NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Gabe Joselow is a producer at NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:48:37
www.nbcnews.com,Sudan's military says it has retaken seat of country's government for the first time in two years,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sudans-military-says-retaken-seat-countrys-government-rcna197429,"CAIRO —Sudan’s militarysaid Friday that it had retaken theRepublican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion of rival paramilitary forces in the capital, after nearly two years of fighting. Social media videos showed its soldiers inside giving the date as the 21st day of Ramadan, the holy Muslim fasting month, which corresponds to Friday. A Sudanese military officer wearing a captain’s epaulettes made the announcement in the video, and confirmed the troops were inside the compound. The palace appeared to be partly in ruins, with soldiers’ steps crunching broken tiles underneath their boots. Soldiers carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers chanted: “God is the greatest!” Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan’s information minister, said the military had retaken the palace in a post on thesocial platform X. “Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,” he wrote. The fall of the Republican Palace, a compound along the Nile River that was the seat of government before the war erupted and is immortalized on Sudanese banknotes and postage stamps, marks another battlefield gain for Sudan’s military. It has made steady advances in recent months under army chiefGen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. It means the rivalRapid Support Forces, under Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have been mostly expelled from the capital of Khartoum after Sudan’s war began in April 2023. Sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the capital Friday, though it was not clear if it involved fighting or was celebratory. The group did not immediately acknowledge the loss, which most likely won’t stop the fighting as the RSF and its allies still hold territory elsewhere in Sudan. Late Thursday, the RSF claimed it seized control of the Sudanese city of al-Maliha, a strategic desert city in North Darfur near the borders of Chad and Libya. Sudan’s military has acknowledged fighting around al-Maliha, but has not said it lost the city. Al-Maliha is about 125 miles north of the city of El Fasher, which remains held by the Sudanese military despite near-daily strikes by the surrounding RSF. The head of theU.N. children’s agencyhas said the conflict created the world’s largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis. The war has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll. The Republican Palace had been the seat of power during the British colonization of Sudan. It also saw some of the first independent Sudanese flags raised over the country in 1956 and had been the main office of Sudan’s president and other top officials. The Sudanese military have long targeted the palace and its grounds, shelling and firing on the compound. Sudan, a nation in northeastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Dagalo led a military coup in 2021. The RSF and Sudan’s military then began fighting each other in 2023. Burhan’s forces, including Sudan’s military and allied militias, have advanced against the RSF since the start of this year. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum. They then pushed in on RSF positions around the capital itself. The fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. Al-Bashir faces charges at theInternational Criminal Courtover carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. accuse the RSF and allied Arab militias of again attacking ethnic African groups in this war. Since the war began, both the Sudanese military and the RSF have faced allegations of human rights abuses. Before President Joe Biden left office, the State Department declared the RSF are committing genocide. The military and the RSF have denied committing abuses.",2025-03-22 00:48:40
www.nbcnews.com,Family of Boeing whistle blower sues company alleging harassment campaign led to suicide,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-boeing-whistle-blower-sues-company-alleging-harassment-campaign-rcna197439,"The family of aBoeing whistle blowerwho had raised alarm over the company’s safety flaws and later died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound has filed a lawsuit against the company alleging wrongful death. John Barnett, 62, of Louisiana, was a former Boeing quality inspector and worked for the aviation giant for more than three decades. He died on March 9, 2024. His attorneys at the time said he was in Charleston to testify in a deposition in his federal legal action against Boeing. Charleston police said there was no indication foul play was suspected. In a civil action complaint filed in Charleston court Wednesday, his family says Barnett was a dedicated employee who found meaning in his job of ensuring plane safety — but his life was turned upside down after he flagged safety issues and Boeing allegedly retaliated and sought to ""break him"" in a campaign of harassment and intimidation. The suit accuses the aviation giant of wrongful death and abuse of process. Barnett had worked for Boeing for 32 years, with 17 of them as a quality manager. Barnett last worked for the company at its 787 plant in North Charleston, known as Boeing South Carolina (BSC). The complaint said Barnett was proud of his job at Boeing, “took his role seriously in protecting the flying public” and wanted to ensure that “every possible defeat was identified, documented and remedied.” However, when he tried to document issues, Boeing management allegedly pressured him to ignore defects and not properly document issues in the aircraft build record, all in an effort to avoid production delays, the complaint claimed. When Barnett persisted, management allegedly harassed, intimidated and sought to discredit him: He was given low performance management scores, was socially isolated and separated from his team, moved to other areas in the plant, and blacklisted from other Boeing divisions, the complaint said. “John did his best to stay positive and persevere. However, eventually the concerted harassment and abuse were too much,” the complaint said. In one instance, one of Barnett's senior managers called him 19 times in an eight-hour period in late October 2016 and 21 times within eight hours a few days later. That manager told him allegedly, “I’m going to push you until you break.” He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, panic attacks and anxiety in 2017, stemming from “his exposure to BSC’s hostile work environment, and John was forced out of Boeing,” the filing said. Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint with the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) against Boeing for retaliating against him in January 2017, which is known as the AIR21 case. Boeing remains under intense public and regulatory scrutiny for a series of aviation incidents. While John’s OSHA complaint was pending, Boeing ""engaged in a scorched-earth series of repeated abuses of process,"" that included allegedly failing to comply with court orders to produce documents — some of which would have allegedly confirmed Barnett's allegations. The court handling the case sanctioned Boeing for its discovery abuse, the complaint said. In late January 2017, Barnett went on a medical leave of absence due to work related stress, emotional distress, and the alleged hostile work environment. He had planned to work at Boeing for at least another 10 years, the complaint said, but he was “constructively discharged” on March 1, 2017. After leaving Boeing, Barrett tried to move on with his life, the complaint said, but on March 9, 2024 “the weight of years of Boeing’s harassment, abuse and humiliation became too much for John to bear, and he took his own life on what was to be the third day of his deposition in the AIR21 case,"" the complaint said. ""Boeing had threatened to break John and break him it did,"" the filing said. The complaint included an email Barrett sent on Feb. 28, 2021 that was quoted in the police report in his death in which he detailed the anguish he felt. “What I am struggling with is, how do you repair or restore a person’s overall outlook on life? I used to be a very happy go lucky guy that loved his job, his Company and the products they built. I had a very positive outlook on life. Boeing has absolutely destroyed my outlook on life. I often sit here and think, what’s the use, what’s the point of life?” the email said. The suit alleged that Boeing knew its conduct would result in PTSD, Barrett's depression, panic attacks and anxiety and ""would in turn lead to an elevated risk of suicide."" ""Boeing may not have pulled the trigger, but Boeing’s conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John’s death,"" the complaint said. The complaint, filed on behalf of Vicky Stokes, Barnett’s mother, and his brothers Rodney Barnett and Michael Barnett, didn't detail a specific amount of damages being sought, but seeks relief for financial loss as well as mental and emotional suffering. ""John Barnett’s whistleblower activities at Boeing and his lawsuit have always been about his concern for the flying public,"" said Brian M. Knowles, an attorney for the Barnett family. ""John’s family and his lawyers are continuing the litigation to fulfill John’s mission. We are seeking justice and accountability from Boeing for John and his family. It has been a long time coming."" Boeing said in a statement: “We are saddened by John Barnett’s death and extend our condolences to his family.” The company had not filed a response to the lawsuit as of Friday.

www.nbcnews.com,Lyft to roll out robotaxis in Atlanta,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/lyft-roll-robotaxis-atlanta-rcna197479,"Lyft is about to enter the increasingly competitive world of robotaxis. The ride-hailing company said Friday that users will be able to take rides in self-driving cars starting this summer, with autonomous vehicles first hitting the streets of Atlanta. The rollout will be done in partnership withMay Mobility, an autonomous vehicle company. Its  self-driving technology will be installed in Toyota Sienna minivans that users will have the chance to take rides in. A Lyft spokesperson added that the company’s next stop will be Dallas, where the company is also aiming to deploy self-driving vehicles in partnership with the companies Mobileye and Marubeni as soon as next year, with “thousands of vehicles and more cities to follow.” In a statement released Thursday, Jeremy Bird, Lyft’s executive vice president of driver experience, said the new venture could create more opportunities for Lyft drivers to earn money off the clock by purchasing their own AVs. “Drivers today come to the Lyft platform for many reasons, but one of the main draws is the flexibility it offers,” Bird wrote. “The only limit is their own schedule, since they need to be available to drive. This is a very real hurdle today, but over time, personally-owned AVs will remove even this limit — allowing people to earn while they are working another job, or taking care of their families, or sleeping.” Robotaxis using self-driving technology can now be found on the streets of at least four U.S. cities and even more abroad, with many major tech companies competing for what analysts believe could be a market that is worth billions if nottrillions.Alphabet’s Waymo, Tesla and Amazonare all pushing forward with self-driving car technology, much of which is already finding its way into ride-sharing cars. In October 2023, Uber announced it would be partnering with Waymo to beginoffering self-driving car ridesin Phoenix. Since then, the company has expanded to offer AVs in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, with plans to expand to Miami in 2026. Despite the growing presence of AVs, some ride-share customers are wary of the new technology. According to a 2023survey by the American Automobile Association, 68% of drivers are afraid of autonomous vehicles. Incidents involving Waymo vehicles have included a carstuck spinning in circlesand acrash into a stationary pole. Even so, Waymo provides around 200,000 self-driving taxi rides every week,according to Forbes. “I’m not a neutral observer. I’m rooting for AVs, not just as a consumer, but because I think they’ll be great for Lyft, as well as the riders and drivers on our platform,” Lyft CEO David Risherwrote in a February statement. “AVs grow the overall rideshare market by providing a safe, engaging, novel mode of transportation, making it even easier for people to get out and about.” Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team.",2025-03-22 00:48:43
www.nbcnews.com,"Tesla owners are trading in their EVs at record levels, analysis shows",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/tesla-owners-are-trading-evs-record-levels-edmunds-says-rcna197501,"AsElon Muskwraps up his second month in the White House,Teslaowners are trading in their electric vehicles at record levels, according to an analysis by national car shopping site Edmunds. The data from Edmunds published on Thursday said that March represented “the highest ever share” it had seen for Tesla trade-ins toward new or used cars from dealerships selling other brands. Since heading to Washington, D.C., in January as a central figure in the second Trump administration, Musk, who is CEO of Tesla, has beenslashingthe federal workforce and government spending, and has gained access to sensitive government computer systems and data, though his efforts have been repeatedly challenged in court. Before assuming leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk spent around $290 million last year to help propelPresident Donald Trumpback to the White House. While investors snapped up Tesla shares after Trump’s victory in November, they’ve beenrushing for the exits of late, pushing the stock’s price down by 42% this year. Waves of protests have targeted Tesla facilities in the U.S. and beyond. Other criminal acts ofvandalismand arson have targeted Tesla stores, vehicles and charging stations across the U.S. In addition, Tesla is facing increased competition from EV makers. In January, S&P Global Mobility found Tesla sales declined about 11% year over year in the U.S., whileFord, Chevrolet and Volkswagen bolstered their sales of EVs, picking up market share. “Shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,” Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, wrote in an email. “As Tesla brand loyalty and interest wavers, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.” The Tesla brand, more than that of any other automaker, is tightly tied to its CEO. In August 2024, Edmunds surveys found that just 2% of car shoppers in the U.S. were unfamiliar with Musk. Edmunds also said that shopping for new models of Tesla vehicles on its platform dropped to its lowest level last month since October 2022 after peaking as late as November. Even before Musk began heading up DOGE, Tesla’sbrand was suffering. Its brand value fell by 26%, or about $15 billion, in 2024, a second straight annual decline, according to research and consulting firm Brand Finance. Many car shoppers trade in their Tesla EVs for a newer model Tesla. Edmunds data didn’t account for those transactions. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",2025-03-22 00:48:45

Speaking two days after he and his colleagues againvoted to keep short-term rates steady, Goolsbee told CNBC that he’s been hearing more concerns from businesses in his region about the impact of tariffs and their potential to raise prices and slow growth. “When you got a lot of uncertainty, I do think you need to wait to see some of these things get cleared up on the policy side,” the central banker said during a “Squawk Box” interview. “I’m out talking to business people and civic leaders throughout this region, and there’s been a decided turn in these conversations over the last six weeks, of anxiety, of pausing, waiting on capital projects, capex, etc., until they figure out tariffs, other fiscal policy.” Nevertheless, Goolsbee said he still expects future rate cuts even if the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach for now as issues play out over PresidentDonald Trump’s tariff plans as well as deregulation and tax cuts. “If we can continue to make progress on inflation over the long run, I believe that rates 12 to 18 months from now will be lower than where they are today,” he said. Speaking separately Friday morning, New York Fed President John Williams also noted the high level of uncertainty around decision-making and economic trends, particularly inflation. “Recent data — both hard and soft — are sending mixed signals. Measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months,” Williams said during a speech in Nassau, the Bahamas. Both policymakers voted with the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee to hold the short-term fed funds rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC noted that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased” and ChairJerome Powellused the term “uncertainty” 10 times in his post-meeting news conference. One question that has come up in recent days has been whether theU.S. economy is headed toward stagflation, or slow growth and rising inflation. “Tariffs, raise prices and reduce output. So that’s a stagflationary impulse, which is different from saying this is stagflation,” Goolsbee said. “The unemployment rate is barely 4% and inflation is in the 2s. So the hard data that we start from is not the stagflation of the 1970s. It’s just the ... the uncomfortable environment is when it’s moving directionally the wrong way.” FOMC meeting participants kept their projections for two rate cuts through 2025. Markets, though, think the Fed will be more aggressive, pricing in the equivalent of three quarter percentage point reductions, according toCME Group data.

www.nbcnews.com,Experimental treatment borrowed from blood cancer shows promise for pediatric brain tumors,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/experimental-treatment-borrowed-blood-cancer-shows-promise-pediatric-b-rcna195154,"In an early-stage clinical trial, the therapy nearly doubled the expected survival time of young patients. Still, experts caution that more research is needed. Gavin Nielsen was 2 years old when he was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain cancer. The smiley toddler had diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, a cancer that occurs in the part of the brain stem that controls vital functions including breathing,blood pressureand heart rate. Very few treatment options exist, and the prognosis for children diagnosed with the disease is, on average, less than one year. “When we have a child newly diagnosed with this disease, we walk into the room and tell the child’s parents their child has a terminal disease and the only option is palliative radiation,” said Dr. Robbie Majzner, director of the pediatric and young adult cancer cell therapy program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital. Gavin’s parents started him on radiation. For 30 days, he had to be sedated daily for the treatment. But they also started looking for clinical trials to enroll Gavin in. At the time, many of the trials for DIPG had a minimum age requirement of 3 years old, his parents, Nate and Ashlee, said. But Gavin did qualify for one trial, led by Dr. Nicholas Vitanza, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at the Seattle Children’s Hospital Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Vitanza is part of a growing group of researchers exploring whether animmunotherapy called CAR-T therapy, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, could be effective for treating Gavin’s type of brain cancer. The treatment programs a person’s own T cells — immune cells that usually fight infection — to identify and attack proteins found on tumor cells. CAR-T has been used totreat certain blood cancersfor two decades and got its first Food and Drug Administration approval in 2017. In recent years, doctors have been exploring the treatment in solid tumors,including those in the brain, where patients have few options. Gavin enrolled in Vitanza’s trial before his third birthday, after he had already completed his radiation treatment. Doctors started by extracting T cells from Gavin’s blood. Those cells were then modified in a lab to go after the tumor target, called B7-H3. About a month later, he started getting infusions of the T cells, delivered directly into his cerebrospinal fluid. Once reintroduced back into the body, the T cells replicate, creating a surge ofcancer-fighting immune cells. The results of Vitanza’s early-stageclinical trialwere published in Nature Medicine in January. In addition to Gavin, 20 children and young adults with DIPG got CAR-T therapy every two to four weeks. The median survival was about 20 months — nearly double the expected prognosis. Three patients, however, are still alive 3 ½ to 4 ½ years after starting their treatment. Gavin is one of those patients. Now 6 years old, he’s lived four times longer than doctors initially predicted. “It’s the biggest miracle that I could ever ask for, just to have time,” Ashlee said. Gavin is still getting CAR-T infusions every two to three weeks. Sometimes, for about 12 hours after the infusions, he has headaches, nausea and vomiting. Other times, he’s ready to run around on the soccer field. Dr. Mark Souweidane, director of pediatric neurosurgery at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, who wasn’t involved with the trial, said the results were encouraging, but added that it’s not “out of the realm of the norm” to have some patients survive longer. “There are going to be outliers. You will get 5% to 10% of kids who live beyond two years,” he said. Souweidane said more trials will need to confirm whether CAR-T therapy is, indeed, the reason Gavin and the two other patients in the trial are living much longer than expected. If so, doctors will need to understand whether the therapy could be this effective for everyone with the disease. “I’m cautiously optimistic that this at least shows some efficacy we can build on in the future,” said Dr. Patrick Grogan, a neuro-oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida. “Until there is a Phase 3 clinical trial with a control group that gets the current standard of care, or robust data from a Phase 2 trial, I tend to take results with a grain of salt.” While CAR-T therapy can be highly effective for certain blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, scientists are still in the beginning stages of understanding whether the treatment can be used for solid tumors, which make up the majority of cancers. “This is entirely experimental,” Vitanza said. The reason CAR-T therapy works so well in certain blood cancers is because thesecancers tend to be homogeneous, meaning their tumor cells are uniform. This gives the immune cells a clear target to latch onto. That’s not the case for solid tumors, which tend to have many different cell types that often differ within individual tumors. The proteins found in abundance on solid-tumor cells also usually aren’t unique to cancer cells, meaning modified CAR-T cells will also attack healthy cells that have the same target proteins. “It’s very difficult to find a target specifically on the surface of cancer but not on any tissue,” said Majzner. The goal, he said, is to find a target that’s found in much higher numbers on cancer cells than on healthy cells. The nonuniform nature of solid tumors means it’s also possible many cancer cells will go undetected by CAR-T cells. “If you happen to go after a target that is only expressed in 50% of cells, you may have an effect against those 50% of cells but the rest are spared,” Grogan said. Treating anything in the brain presents additional challenges. The brain is surrounded by a difficult-to-penetrate barrier called the blood-brain barrier, which blocks toxins from entering. In their trial, Vitanza and his team opted to deliver the modified cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, in part to bypass the blood-brain barrier. This also ensured a high concentration of the modified T cells ended up in the cancerous part of the brain rather than in other parts of the body, possibly blunting the number of healthy cells the modified cells come into contact with. The goal of Phase 1 clinical trials like this is to show whether a therapy shows promise and appears to be safe. “When you’re dealing with experimental therapies, especially Phase 1 trials, they’re designed to find what is a safe, tolerable dose. You obviously hope there’s a benefit, but it is impossible to quote any benefit, because you’re learning this in real time,” Vitanza said. Just one patient out of 21 in Vitanza’s trial had a severe side effect, bleeding in the tumor. Several other early CAR-T trials for DIPG are happening at cancer centers across the U.S. While many questions remain, experts said they are cautiously optimistic the therapy could become a badly needed treatment for DIPG. Kids like Gavin are a crucial piece of the research. “One thing I always think of is it’s not just Gavin, it’s those kids coming after him, that we’ve met along the way, that didn’t get this chance,” his father, Nate, said. “I think it’s for those kids that we continue.” Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations. She reports on health, science and the environment and is a graduate of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York.

www.nbcnews.com,She had an abortion after a botched paternity test. Now she's suing the DNA company.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/abortion-botched-paternity-test-now-s-suing-dna-company-rcna197452,"Who was the father: Her fiancé, or the man with whom she had a brief fling? In Oct. 2024, that was the urgent question for a New York City woman. She thought she got her answer when a paternity test showed there was a 99.9% probability her unborn baby was the product of that short-lived fling. The results, she says, prompted her to have an abortion in order to preserve her relationship with her fiancé. “I decided to save my marriage,” she said. “I was already five months pregnant. I decided to terminate the pregnancy.” Four months later, the woman, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, says she got a startling message from DNA Diagnostics Center, the testing company, which was now seeking to amend its original paternity results. The company had just issued a new, corrected report which showed there was now a 0% chance the other man from that fling was the father. Speaking exclusively to the NBC New York I-Team, the woman said she would never have ended her pregnancy if the genetics company had gotten the results correct the first time. She’s now suing DNA Diagnostics Center, claiming the company’s negligence left her relationship in ruins. “You took away the family I could have had. This was the person I was marrying. This is the person I wanted to build a family with,” she said. “The reason I took action was because I believed in these results. I thought this was something that was one hundred percent true. And it led me to the abortion.” DNA Diagnostics Center, declined to answer questions about the paternity test mix-up. Instead, the company sent the I-Team a statement emphasizing its genetics testing methods are sound. “Over the past 30 years, DDC has provided reliable and accurate testing to millions of customers,” the statement read. “If any issue or concern is raised, we take immediate action, and DDC will perform a retest to validate the initial result. We have established industry-leading processes and best practices across our laboratory and company to ensure customers are rapidly notified of any issues and quality assurance steps are followed.” The company also declined to explain how it came to review the woman’s initial genetic results months after they were issued — or whether that review included other paternity tests which might also have suffered problems. The woman told the I-Team she was uncomfortable about the paternity test almost from the beginning, because she says DNA Diagnostics directed her to have blood drawn at a Bronx address which appears to also house a beauty salon that offers cosmetic procedures like facials, body contouring, eyelash, and hair/scalp treatments. “If you’re going in to ask for a paternity test, you don’t want to go do that in front of people who are getting their hair done,” said Craig Phemister, the woman’s attorney. The third-party Bronx company which collected the woman’s genetic sample declined comment. According to the DNA Diagnostics website, the Ohio company is “the World’s Leading Relationship DNA Testing Center,” having conducted more than 20 million DNA tests since 1995. Phemister said he believes the sheer number of genetic tests completed by the company suggests there could be more errors. “The field this company is in is a field that cannot have mistakes like this,” he said. “I’m sure we’re going to find, and time will tell, there will be other people that come forward and learn that these same things have happened to them.” This is not the first time DNA Diagnostics Center has been accused of making genetics testing errors which have enormous ripple effects for families and relationships. In 2018, Joel Santiago, a parent from Connecticut, sued the firm after one of its paternity tests concluded he was not the biological father of his first-born child. About 18 months later, Santiago says he got amended results from DNA Diagnostics Center showing the opposite conclusion — that he actually was her dad. But by that time, he said his relationship with the child’s biological mother had ended, effectively depriving him of participating in the first two years of his daughter’s childhood. “It completely changed the trajectory of my life,” Santiago said. “Precious moments like naming my child, witnessing her birth, watching her first steps, were all erased.” Joel Santiago’s lawsuit against DNA Diagnostics ended with a jury awarding him $2.5 million in damages. Steven Errante, the attorney who won that award, said — because the company admitted liability for the laboratory error — the trial mostly focused on damages. Thus, he said he was limited in his ability to get to the bottom of exactly how the DNA testing firm discovered there was an issue with Joel’s original results. “It was always mystifying to us because, in Joel’s case, it was almost eighteen months later that they called him to say they’ve made a mistake,” Errante said. “Why would you be looking at these results eighteen months later? We never really got an answer.” DNA Diagnostics declined to answer questions about Joel Santiago’s paternity test or how the decision was made to issue corrected results. Paternity tests make up only part of the company’s business. According to the DNA Diagnostics Center website, the firm also provides DNA testing for government agencies, including genetic testing for law enforcement in criminal cases and immigration proceedings. Phemister believes his client’s experience with mistaken paternity results raises questions about DNA Diagnostics facilities which may provide results in a whole host of civil and criminal contexts. “The same DNA labs are doing testing that is relied on by the court systems,” Phemister said. “If they make errors and then not discover those errors for months or years later, that’s it. These people’s lives are devastated.” Chris Glorioso is a reporter for NBC New York.",2025-03-22 00:48:58
www.nbcnews.com,Scientists puzzled by surprising rise in ADHD prescriptions among adult women,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/adhd-medication-women-prescriptions-stimulants-misuse-rcna196936,"Prescriptions for ADHD medications have been spiking in recent years, with the sharpest increase among middle-aged and older women. They’re also the least likely to misuse the prescription stimulants, anew studyfound. The rise among women ages 35 to 64 has been substantial. At the end of 2022, 1.7 million women in this age group were prescribed stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin for ADHD, compared to 1.2 million prescriptions in 2019. There’s been an overall jump in ADHD prescriptions since the pandemic and the rise of telehealth. The new analysis, published in JAMA Psychiatry by researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also looked into how the medications are being misused — that is, taking more of the drugs than prescribed, taking them at times that differed from what the doctor ordered or using medication from someone else’s prescription The researchers used data from more than 83,000 adults, ages 18 to 64 who participated in the 2021-2022 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Information on prescriptions came from the 2019-2022 IQVIA Total Patient Tracker and National Prescription Audit New to Brand databases. They found that the prevalence of misuse of prescription stimulants among women aged 35 to 64 was significantly lower than it was among men of the same age (13.7% versus 22.0%). Middle-aged women also misused their medications less than younger women (13.7% versus 36.8%). Three types ofstimulants are approved for ADHD: amphetamine (Dexedrine, Adderall); methamphetamine (Desoxyn); and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Overall, just over a quarter of people with prescriptions for ADHD medications reported misusing them. About 9% had what is calledprescription stimulant use disorder, or addiction. People taking amphetamines or methamphetamines were more likely to misuse than those taking methylphenidates. The researchers aren’t sure why there was such a big increase in older adult women being prescribed stimulants for ADHD. “It is a very large increase that I can’t fully explain,” said a study co-author, Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director at the National Institute on Drug Abuse The size of the increase in middle-aged women is surprising, said Aaron Brinen, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who was not involved in the study. Girls with the neurodevelopmental disorder may not be diagnosed because their symptoms are often more subtle than those exhibited by boys, who are more likely to show symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsiveness, research indicates. “I wonder if it speaks to women feeling more empowered to talk about what they are needing and about their struggles in life,” Brinen said. They may realize that they had ADHD as children but were never diagnosed. “Girls are more likely to be overlooked because the way they express ADHD isn’t likely to be captured by teachers,” he added. Brinen has female friends who weren’t diagnosed and treated until they were in their 50s. “It was the first time in their lives that they felt functional,” he said. “It’s a tragedy that it took so long.” Untreated ADHD can lead to feelings of failure and depression, Brinen said. “People think of them as not trying, but they are constantly trying and meeting disappointment,” he added. Brinen suspects women with ADHD are less likely to misuse the stimulants because their prescriptions make life easier. They don’t get high from the stimulants, they just feel more normal. Women with ADHD sometimes manage to get by until they hit a stage where life becomes more difficult and challenging, said Mariely Hernandez, a clinical psychologist who specializes in addiction and ADHD and is a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of psychiatry at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. The symptoms of ADHD might become a much bigger problem when women have children, Hernandez said. “The executive function needed to manage a family may exceed their cognitive resources, especially when the children are young,” she added. “Then their symptoms become too impairing.” Hormonal status can also affect the severity of symptoms, Hernandez said. “We see a lot of women diagnosed at menopause,” she said, adding that low estrogen levels in a woman with ADHD can lead to a dopamine deficit. “Dopamine underlies our reward system,” she explained. “If you don’t make enough or aren’t able to properly utilize it, you won’t be able to focus as well. Women will say, ‘I can’t live like this. I want to be evaluated.’” Linda Carroll is a Peabody Award-winning journalist and regular contributor to NBC News.

www.nbcnews.com,'Severance' season 2 finale leaves 'outies' with another cliffhanger — and season 3 is on the way,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/severance-season-2-finale-cliffhanger-apple-tv-lumon-rcna197174,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for the show ""Severance."" A goat, a marching band and a big decision. ""Severance"", the Apple TV+ series that hasbecome a cultural phenomenon, ended its second season Thursday with another major cliffhanger. The finale provided answers — or at least some semblance of clarity — around many major questions, but the future of the show's main characters (both innies and outies) remains in doubt. Fans can take some solace in Apple's announcement Friday morning that the show will return for a third season. By far Apple'sbiggest streaming hit, the show has generated a sizable viewership as well as a cottage industry of internet sleuthing andmemes. ""Severance"" was among the top trending topics on X on Friday morning. And much like the first season, ""Severance"" waited for the last scene to throw its biggest curveball. Just as it looks like Mark Scout (Adam Scott) will be able to escape Lumon with his wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), his ""innie"" makes a startling decision: to stay inside the building and with his own love, Helly R. (Britt Lower). The decision marks a turning point for the show. While the combative dynamics between the innies and Lumon remain, the growing tension between the innies and outies on the show is poised to become the primary source of conflict — between Mark S and Mark Scout, and between Helly R and Helena Eagan. It’s a split that is already showing some signs of fracturing fans who are inclined to root for either the innies or the outies. Some fans were moved by the grand gesture from Mark S. “SEVERANCE IS A LOVE STORY,” wroteone X user, with an image of the final shot. As has become common for ""Severance"" fan reactions on the internet, the memes flowed. The sci-fi series follows a group of workers at fictional Lumon Industries who have undergone a so-called severance procedure, permanently dividing their consciousnesses between their work and personal lives. “Innies” and “outies” have no memories of the other’s life. Fans have become captivated by the show’s dystopian premise, as well as the cohort of “innies” that make up Lumon’s dedicated Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team: Mark S., Dylan G. (Zach Cherry), Helly R. (Britt Lower) and Irving B. (John Turturro). Throughout season two, all of the members grapple with their existence as they learn more about their “outies.” Mark Scout (the outie of Mark S.) secretly begins “reintegration,” a painful brain surgery process that would meld his “innie” and “outie” in order to try and remember his experiences as both. It’s all part of an effort to find his wife, Gemma, who was thought to have died in a car accident two years prior but is actually being experimented on by Lumon employees somewhere in the building. The season two finale revolves around “outie” Mark’s mission to save Gemma from the depths of Lumon. Thanks to help from his sister, Devon (Jen Tullock), and former severed floor manager Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), Mark Scout is able to make an appeal to his ""innie,"" Mark S. Their conversation — conducted via recorded messages back and forth on a video camera — becomes heated. Mark S. shares his reluctance to save someone he doesn’t actually know, especially because Gemma’s reunion with Mark Scout would likely mean the lives of all “innies” (including his love interest, Helly R.) will come to an end. Back on the severed floor, Mark S. decides to fulfill his outie’s request after all. Helly R. and Dylan G. help by distracting floor manager Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman), who has thrown a celebration featuring “choreography and merriment” — a particularly surreal scene featuring an animatronic version of Lumon's mythological leader Kier Eagan and an extended performance from a marching band — to commemorate Mark S.’s completion of his work. Mark S. makes his way to the testing floor where he becomes his ""outie,"" Mark Scout, and reunites with Gemma. They escape to the severed floor, where “innie” Mark S. escorts Gemma to a stairwell to help her leave Lumon for good. But rather than go with her, Mark S. ends up choosing to stay behind with Helly R., and they run off, hand-in-hand, down the hallways of Lumon as Gemma looks on screaming Mark’s name. “NEVER. LET. YOUR. WIFE. STOP. YOU. FROM. FINDING. YOUR. SOULMATE. #severance”another fan wrote. “MARK AND HELLY WOULD RATHER LIVE IN HELL THAN A WORLD THAT DOESNT INCLUDE EACH OTHER. this is romance!!”another X user wrote. But others were outraged he would choose navigating the unknowns of the severed floor with Helly R. instead of letting his “outie” be with Gemma. “mark being able to walk towards helly with gemma screaming like that on the other side of the door is actually so black hearted and evil … he will never deserve her #severance”wrote one fan. “i just don’t understand how anyone could look at someone screaming and crying like gemma was and go nah bye.. mark s you will pay”wrote another fan. “i love markhelly but honestly… it’s not the same to me now,”added another X user. “they’re almost turning into the villains themselves. i don’t want them to find love and freedom and humanity in this way, you know?” Aside from the dramatic twist at the end, the season 2 finale also revealed one mysterious aspect of the show that fans had been speculating about since season 1: What exactly are the MDR employees doing for Lumon? According to Cobel, Mark S. and the team have been refining Gemma’s four tempers, creating 25 different consciousnesses — or innies — of her. In Gemma’s storyline, it appears each of her consciousness’ experiences is personal to her outie’s tempers in some way, as Lumon tests the limits of the severed chip on the company’s quest to fulfill Kier Eagan’s imagined world without pain. Since the show returned in January after a three-year hiatus, fans have inundated platforms like X and Reddit with memes, theories and evenfan-cam edits.The massive fandom has helped make “Severance” Apple TV’s biggest hit, with millions of people tuning in week after week. Ben Stiller, a director and executive producer of the show, has assured fans that there will not be as long of a hiatus between season two and three as there was between seasons one and two. “No, the plan is not to [wait three years],” Stillertold Travis and Jason Kelce on an episode of their podcast, “New Heights.”“Hopefully we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.” During arecent appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,”Stiller also teased that the creatives behind the series “know what the ending is, but how we’re getting there is the creative process.” In the meantime, fans will have to sit tight — though that may be easier said than done. “More Severance please…NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!”wrote “The Daily Show Host” Jon Stewart, tagging Stiller in a post on X. “(but actually thank you for what we got!)” Saba Hamedy is the trends and culture editor for NBC News.

www.nbcnews.com,Kat Graham's racial justice work comes through in new Tyler Perry film 'Duplicity',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/kat-grahams-racial-justice-work-comes-new-tyler-perry-film-duplicity-rcna197378,"Kat Graham stars as a high-powered attorney who finds herself entangled in a deeply personal case in Tyler Perry’s new film, “Duplicity,” out on Prime Video. Graham, who had a breakout role in “The Vampire Diaries,” plays Marley Wells, a lawyer pursuing justice for her best friend’s husband, who was shot by a white police officer. There are, of course, dramatic twists and turns along the way. The actress said she was immediately drawn to the project because of its real-world relevance. She told NBC News that losingher brother to gun violencea few years ago has deeply shaped her perspective on justice and the importance of addressing systemic violence. “When I got the script and realized that the character was seeking justice for an unarmed Black man who was shot by police, I felt an immediate connection,” she said. “I knew I had to be part of telling this story.” Graham, who added that she is “drawn to any and everything that Tyler Perry does,” said that she wants the film to ignite meaningful conversations about police violence and systemic injustice among audiences. “I hope people start looking at what’s happening in the news and asking the hard questions,” she said. “We’ve become desensitized to these stories, and that’s not normal.” Graham’s commitment to social justice goes beyond the screen. “Equal rights and human rights have been my focus,” she said. She’s worked with theUnited Nationssince 2013, and serves as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, focusing on refugee rights and displacement crises. She has also collaborated withRotary Internationalto support global humanitarian efforts, including education and clean water initiatives. “I spend a good chunk of my life working to amplify the voices of marginalized communities,” she said. “Playing this character felt like a gift from God — it gave me the opportunity to be on the right side of history and to tell a story that matters.” In 2020, Kat Graham produced “At Risk Youth,” aPSA for the Black Lives Matter movementdirected by Darren Genet and inspired by the police killings of Laquan McDonald and Tamir Rice. Graham called the PSA’s message “more relevant now than ever,” urging continued justice and accountability. “Watching a movie is just the beginning,” she said. “Use your voice, support organizations that advocate for change, and don’t be afraid to have difficult conversations. If this film makes even one person more aware, then we’ve done our job.” As Graham continues to seek out roles that align with her advocacy work, she remains committed to using her platform to elevate marginalized voices. “I always want to play characters who fight to win, who empower others,” she said. “This film is more than just a thriller — it’s a reminder that we have a responsibility to keep these conversations alive.” Fredlyn Pierre Louis is a Production Assistant for Early Today and a featured contributor for NBC News on digital and broadcast.",2025-03-22 00:49:05
www.nbcnews.com,Former Eminem employee charged with leaking unreleased music,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-eminem-employee-charged-leaking-unreleased-music-rcna197492,"Rapper Eminem said ""significant damage was caused"" and his team is ""appreciative"" after his former longtime employee was charged with leaking his unreleased music online. Joseph Strange, a 46-year-old from Holly, Michigan, was charged with criminal infringement of copyright and interstate transportation of stolen goods after allegedly leaking the rapper’s unreleased songs,Michigan prosecutors announced Wednesday. The criminal complaint said that to date, over 25 songs have been played or distributed on the internet without Eminem’s or his label’s consent. According to the criminal complaint, the songs were originally created by Eminem between 1999 and 2018 and were in various stages of development. Strange worked for Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, from 2007 to 2021, when he was let go. ""Eminem and his team are very appreciative of the efforts by the FBI Detroit bureau for its thorough investigation which led to the charges against Joe Strange,"" Eminem’s spokesperson, Dennis Dennehy, said in a statement. ""The significant damage caused by a trusted employee to Eminem’s artistic legacy and creative integrity cannot be overstated, let alone the enormous financial losses incurred by the many creators and collaborators that deserve protection for their decades of work. We will continue to take any and all steps necessary to protect Eminem’s art and will stop at nothing to do so,"" he added. Eminem’s reps and Wade Fink, an attorney for Strange, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Prosecutors say that on Jan. 16, the FBI was contacted by employees of Eminem’s music studio in Ferndale, Michigan, after they discovered that unreleased, still-under-development music was available on the Internet. The complaint says the employees received and recognized an image of the list of unreleased music taken from a hard drive in the Ferndale studio and being sold online. The FBI was able to identify and locate several people who had bought the unreleased tunes, who then identified Strange as the seller. According to the criminal complaint, Strange was one of just four employees who had access to the studio's hard drives containing Eminem's music. The FBI searched Strange’s residence and found hard drives containing copies of the unreleased music and found financial records showing payment to Strange for the music, prosecutors say. Investigators also found handwritten notes and lyric sheets created by Eminem. The FBI interviewed a man from Canada who bought the unreleased music. He said he paid $8,500 for four songs via Bitcoin and had raised the money with the help of a group of Eminem fans online, the complaint says. Overall, the man believed he sent $50,000 worth of Bitcoin payments to Strange over a six-month period and purchased 25 songs in total. ""Protecting intellectual property from thieves is critical in safeguarding the exclusive rights of creators and protecting their original work from reproduction and distribution by individuals who seek to profit from the creative output of others,"" Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Julie Beck, said in a statement. Fink toldThe Associated Pressthat Strange is a married father of two and called the charges against his client “untested allegations.” “We will handle the matter in a courtroom and we have great faith in the judges of our district,” he said. If convicted of criminal infringement of a copyright, Strange faces a maximum of five years in prison and an up to $250,000 fine. Meanwhile, the interstate transportation of stolen goods charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison.

www.nbcnews.com,Bella Ramsey was diagnosed with autism after 'The Last of Us' crew member spotted signs,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bella-ramsey-shares-autism-diagnosis-season-one-last-us-rcna197497,"Bella Ramsey, star of the HBO drama “The Last of Us,” revealed their autism diagnosis in an interview withBritish Voguepublished on Wednesday — a diagnosis that was due in part to a crew member on the hit zombie drama recognizing the telltale signs. “I’ve spoken a bit about neurodivergence before, but I always for some reason didn’t want to,” Ramsey admitted. “I got diagnosed with autism when I was filming season one ofThe Last of Us.” While shooting in Canada, a crew member with an autistic daughter assumed Ramsey might be autistic too. This moment sparked Ramsey’s decision to seek a formal psychiatric assessment, leading to their diagnosis. Reflecting on their childhood, Ramsey described feeling out of place in school, often feeling more comfortable around adults. They mentioned experiencing sensory sensitivities common among autistic people, including a heightened awareness of others’ micro-expressions and body language. Ramsey also noted their discomfort with the heavy waterproof gear and thermals that were required for filming in the chilly Canadian wilderness, describing it as “too much stuff on my body.” Despite the challenges, Ramsey shared how autism and acting have become interconnected in helping them hone their craft by observing people and adopting a routine. “I’ve always been watching and learning from people. Having to learn more manually how to socialize and interact with the people around me has helped me with acting,” they said. “I have a call time, and I’m told what to wear, how to stand, where to stand and what to eat.” Ramsey describes the diagnosis as “freeing..."" and allows them to have more grace for themselves as they learn more about themself. They find that sharing their diagnosis helps them “unmask immediately,” allowing them to be their authentic self after without feeling the need to hide. “My experience of moving through the world is as an autistic person,” they said. “There’s no reason for people not to know.” Terry Dickerson is a news associate with NBC News Digital.",2025-03-22 00:49:12
www.nbcnews.com,Women's sports bars expected to quadruple across the U.S. in 2025,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-life-and-style/womens-sports-bars-quadruple-us-2025-rcna196763,"The boom coincides with the soaring viewership and popularity of professional and college women’s sports. The number of bars in the United States dedicated to showing women’s sports is expected to quadruple this year, from six at the start of 2025 to about two dozen by the end of the year. Three women’s sports bars have opened so far this year, and 14 more are expected to join them in the coming months, according to an NBC News analysis. The venues have broken ground or plan to in every region of the country, including major cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco and smaller cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Kansas City, Missouri. Two of the venues had their grand openings this past week — Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix and 1972 Women’s Sports Pub in Austin, Texas — and another, Set the Bar in Omaha, Nebraska, will debut Friday night, right in time for the first round of the annual Women’s March Madness basketball tournament. Molly Huyck, the owner of Set the Bar, said she was inspired to open her own space after she read about the United States’ first women’s sports bar, The Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, and visited another, Seattle’s Rough & Tumble. Those bars, which both opened in 2022, seemed a world apart from the typical sports bars she was accustomed to, she said. “The vibe that I feel when I go into other sports bars is it’s dark, it’s kind of a cement block, and you definitely have to ask to get women’s sports on and, for sure, to get the audio on women’s sports,” Huyck said, adding that she plans to dedicate the bar to her late sister Kelsey, who loved women's sports and died two years ago at 35. “I’m super excited to have a sports bar that feels good and a place where everyone’s welcome.” The women’s sports bar boom coincides with a surge in interest in and viewership of women’s college and professional sports in recent years. For example, in Nebraska,more than 92,000 fans filledMemorial Stadium in Lincoln in 2023 to see the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers volleyball team, who were five-time NCAA champions at the time, beat the University of Nebraska Omaha’s Mavericks, making it the largest crowd to witness a women’s sporting event. TheNCAA women’s basketball national championship gamelast year between South Carolina and Iowa was the most watched basketball game — including men’s, women’s, pro and college basketball — since 2019, with an estimated18.9 million viewers. Many of those viewers were drawn to the sport by the media frenzy surrounding Iowa star Caitlin Clark, who has gone on to play for the Indiana Fever in the WNBA, which alsohad their most watched season last yearand the highest attendance for games in more than two decades. In addition to basketball, a slew of other women’s sports have also had spikes in viewers. A four-year, $240 million TV deal recently went into effect for the National Women’s Soccer League, whose total viewershipincreased 95%last year compared with the 2023 season. The Professional Women’s Hockey League launched in 2023 andreached more than 100,000 total YouTube subscribersand more than 40 million views over its first season. And last year, an average of more than 74 million viewers globally streamed a rematch between boxing greats Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano on Netflix, making it themost watched women’s sporting eventin U.S. history. The Sports Bra,opened by Jenny Nguyen in April 2022, is thought to be the first women’s sports bar in the United States. It has become so well-known in Portland and across the country that Nguyenannounced plans to franchise last year. Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit and the husband of tennis legend Serena Williams, pledged to help fund the expansion. Deborah Pleva, the vice president of engagement for The Sports Bra, said that there are about eight steps to open a franchise location and that the bar is working with several prospective franchiseeswho are ""quite far along in the process."" However, the bar isn't quite ready to announce any new locations yet. “There is a high level of interest in the brand, but we’re being very selective to be sure potential franchisees are aligned with our mission and 100% dedicated to women’s sports and fandom,” Pleva said. NBC News spoke to six business owners who opened women’s sports bars recently or plan to open them this year. All of them, including Huyck, mentioned The Sports Bra as part of their inspiration. Jax Diener, 58, said that she reached out to Nguyen in 2022, shortly after The Sports Bra opened, and asked about franchising the business but that Nguyen said she wasn’t ready for that yet. Diener had dreamed of opening a sports bar for about 30 years by the time The Sports Bra opened. She said she would go to a sports bar in Marina del Rey, California, almost every Sunday for yearsto watch football. “I left every Sunday saying, ‘I want to open my own sports bar someday,’ because I don’t want to feel the way I just felt in here for hours, like we spent so much money and so much time in that bar every Sunday only to feel like we weren’t smart enough by the gentleman that were in the bar,” Diener said. “We weren’t strategic enough. We don’t understand. We don’t know what we’re talking about and just feeling like it wasn’t for us.” Diener said her dream of opening a bar wasn’t initially about women’s sports, even though she has long been a fan. Diener attended the first-ever WNBA game in June 1997 between the New York Liberty and the Los Angeles Sparks and was a Sparks season ticket holder for a decade. At first, she said, she just wanted an inclusive place where all people could watch sports “and feel just like anybody else watching sports on TV.” Though Nguyen wasn’t ready to franchise back in 2022, Diener said she didn’t want to wait too long to open her dream bar, because she saw the surge in interest in women’s sports. She started the process of opening the bar and restaurant in September 2023 and aimed to open in time for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. She and her wife, Emme Eddy, opened Watch Me! in Long Beach, California, ahead of  the opening ceremony in July — one day after they got their business license. “Of course, everybody said to me: ‘There’s no way you can open a restaurant in under a year. There’s no way you’ll make it happen,’” Diener recalled. “And I said, ‘Watch me!’ And we’ve proved ourselves and our name over and over and over.” Though interest in women’s sports continues to increase, all of the women’s sports bar owners who spoke to NBC News said they had to crowdfund or dig into their savings to start their businesses. Diener said she and her wife didn’t want to take out business loans, so they opened Watch Me! primarily using all of the funds they had saved for retirement. They raised about $27,000 through crowdfunding, but that wasn’t nearly enough, she said. Recently, she said, she has started applying for grants, and the bar is also diversifying its offerings — for example, by hosting trivia nights, “sip and paint” events and live music. Monica Brady and Rachel Glenn plan to open The Dub in Kansas City, Missouri, later this year. They signed a lease on a space for the bar in September, and they’ve been working with the city to get their final permits to begin construction, which Glenn said will take about three months. They hope to open by June 1 and are trying toraise $60,000in the meantime, noting on their crowdfunding page that not meeting their goal could delay the bar’s opening. They’ve also been hosting pop-up events since June, selling T-shirts and other merchandise promoting the bar. “Shockingly, banks don’t want to give loans to first-time bar owners — I say that tongue in cheek — especially women queer bar owners,” Brady said. “It has been a barrier to get a business loan, and I know that we’re not alone in that. I know that a lot of our peers opening in other cities have come up against the same exact situation, so that’s frustrating.” Annie Weaver and Miranda Spencer, who opened The 99ers Sports Bar in Denver in December, are the bar’s only two employees. To pay off their loans as soon as possible, Spencer said, they both work day jobs, Weaver in insurance underwritingand Spencer in sales engineering, and then one or both of them work until the bar closes at 10 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends. Weaver said they struggled to find a space to lease because neither of them own businesses or homes that could be used as collateral. Their motto throughout the process has become “everything’s figure-out-able.” “Five days before we signed our lease, I went to Miranda and I was like, ‘I’m done, I can’t do this anymore. We’ve been told no so many times,’” Weaver said. “And then five days later, we signed our lease. And now, looking back, I would have been so mad at myself that I backed out. This is the most incredible experience, and I can’t imagine it not being a part of my life.” Huyck, who will open SET the Bar in Omaha on Friday, retired a year and a half ago after having worked for 21 years at PayPal and invested $250,000 of her own money into starting the business. She raised an additional $850,000 through investors, she said, and she has shared her investment model structure with other women’s sports bar owners. She always planned to use investors, she said, and opted to use her own money because of the additional hurdles a bank loan would have presented. She’ll be opening the bar debt-free. Many of the bar owners not only wanted to avoid the macho attitudes they’ve encountered at traditional sports bars, but they also wanted to create more inclusive experiences for patrons by, for example, offering mocktails, local beers, craft cocktails and wine. Some of them said they intentionally created spaces with more light, as traditional sports bars can be dark, and Huyck said SET the Bar also has plants and bright colors. Spencer said that whenever people walk in the door, she and Annie — and then, as a result, the other customers — will start clapping and sometimes “hollering.” Spencer said she enjoys reading the bar’s Google reviews, and a recent one described it as “the bar where everyone knows your name.” All of the bar owners said they want to ensure that everyone feels welcome, particularly the LGBTQ community, which most of the owners are a part of. “We are a married couple, and people can connect the dots and see that this is lesbian-owned, and we’re proud of that, but we don’t lead with that,” Diener said, adding that the bar is open to everyone, including families with kids. “We lead with this — celebrating women’s sports — and that’s what separates us from other queer bars out there.” Weaver said that she doesn’t think it’s an accident that many of the owners of women’s sports bars are part of the LGBTQ community. “We didn’t have spaces where we felt safe or like we could be ourselves growing up,” Weaver said. “I don’t think that’s random. I think it makes sense to me why it is the way it is, but we still want to be inclusive to everybody.” The moments that many of the bar owners said they look forward to are when their bars are standing-room-only during important games. In January, just a month after The 99ers Sports Bar opened, the Professional Women’s Hockey League played a game in Denver, with more than 14,000 fans in the arena,setting a record for the highest attendanceat a professional women’s hockey game in the United States. Weaver said people in the crowd held signs that said “After party at the 99ers.” Customers filled the bar, and then a line formed outside despite the cold weather. “We need more of these,” Weaver said of the bars. “We need them all over the United States. They need to exist everywhere. Everybody deserves to have a space like this.” Jo Yurcaba is a reporter for NBC Out.

www.nbcnews.com,A one-of-a-kind Paul Skenes baseball card sells for $1.11 million via auction,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/mlb/paul-skenes-baseball-card-rcna197477,"A one-of-a-kind Paul Skenes baseball card has been sold for $1.11 million after a two-week auction. There was a total of 64 bids on Skenes’ debut patch card, which is autographed and contains a patch that was on the pitcher’s jersey for his heralded major league debut in May. The final price announced by Fanatics Collect late Thursday night included a 20% buyer’s premium. The buyer was not identified. Fanatics Collect plans to donate its proceeds from the sale to the LA Fire Relief Fund. The 22-year-old Skenes is slated to make $875,000 while in the major leagues this year with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The card’s journey over the last few months has generated the kind of buzz typically reserved for iconic collectibles featuring Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Mickey Mantle and Ken Griffey Jr. The debut patch cards are featured in Topps Chrome Update. There were 91 in the first year in 2023 and 251 last year. While the cards have attracted the attention of some young major leaguers and longtime collectors alike, most of the attention has been focused on Skenes’ card in particular. A combination of Skenes’ burgeoning stardom, the considerable reach of his girlfriend, LSU gymnast/influencer Livvy Dunne and a head-turning offer the Pirates made in hopes of securing the card fueled the hype for the one-of-one collectible. It was claimed by an 11-year-old in the Los Angeles area after he discovered the redemption code for the Skenes card in a pack he received as part of a Christmas present. He declined the Pirates’ offer and instead turned over the card to Fanatics Collect, which has given it the “white glove” service for the last two months. Skenes was voted the National League Rookie of the Year after he went 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA in 23 starts for Pittsburgh last year. The right-hander is slated to start for the Pirates on opening day next week.",2025-03-22 00:49:17
www.nbcnews.com,Former NBA player and coach claims sex abuse by Indiana University team doctor,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-nba-player-coach-claims-sex-abuse-indiana-university-team-docto-rcna197293,"Former NBA player and coach Butch Carter claims in an amended lawsuit filed Thursdaythat he was sexually abused by the doctor for the Indiana University basketball team when he was on the squad. Carter, who went on to play for the New York Knicks, the Los Angeles Lakers and other NBA teams and was head coach of the Toronto Raptors, is the fifth former Indiana University basketball player to say he complained tolegendary coach Bobby Knightabout Dr. Bradford Bomba Sr.’s performing unnecessary rectal examinations on young, healthy players. His account was includedthis monthin an amended complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana that accused school officials of failing to protect student-athletes from Bomba. Carter is now a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Indiana University trustees and longtime men’s basketball trainer Tim Garl, who is accused of having known about the sexual abuse complaints but done nothing about it, according to the lawsuit, which was originally filed in October with two plaintiffs. Carter and the others are suing under Title IX, a federal law that requires all colleges and universities that receive federal funds to put safeguards in place to protect students from sexual predators. The suit alleges that in 1979 at the university’s Assembly Hall, Bomba “put on gloves, lubed his fingers and told Carter to bend over the table” before he inserted at least one of his fingers into Carter’s anus. Carter, 66, who played on the men’s basketball team from 1976 to 1980, said no other doctor had ever performed a rectal examination on him as part of a physical examination. According to the suit, not long afterward, Carter complained to Knight, who led the Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000; to team trainer Bob Young; and to George Taliaferro, who worked in the office of the university president, “about what Dr. Bomba, Sr. had done to me.” Carter said in the lawsuit that Young told him it was part of a normal exam. In an earlier account included in the lawsuit, an anonymous accuser, now known to be Carter, said that before practice started in his senior year, he told Knight he never wanted to see Bomba again for medical care and that Knight responded: “You’re going to take a physical.” Carter said he told Knight that he was going to see Dr. Robert Miller, after which Knight “left it alone.” In the earlier account, Carter said that when he told his mentor, Taliaferro, the first African American football player at Indiana University, that Bomba had “put his finger up my ass,” Taliaferro responded, “Bomba is a piece of s---.” Knight, Taliaferro and Young are all deceased. Carter said in the lawsuit that during his senior year, he complained multiple times to Knight about Bomba’s abusive behavior during physical exams with athletes and that he fought with Knight multiple times about players being near Bomba but that to his knowledge, Knight took no action to address his complaints. In the lawsuit, Carter said that when he played in the NBA, he received annual physical examinations from team doctors on a routine basis and that only one, during a training camp, involved a rectal examination because he had a swollen prostate at the time. Carter said in his affidavit that he complained about Bomba to top officials in the athletic department years before the four other plaintiffs — John Flowers, Haris Mujezinovic, Charlie Miller and Larry Richardson Jr. — were allegedly abused. “I am proud to come forward and I hope that other IU basketball players will come forward to share their experiences publicly,” Carter said in a statement Thursday. Bomba, 88, could not immediately be reached for comment at numbers listed for him. Mark Bode, a spokesperson for the university, and William Beggs, Bomba’s attorney, did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Bode previously referred NBC News to astatement in Septemberthat said the university had hired a private law firm to conduct an independent review of a former student-athlete's allegations that he was subjected to inappropriate prostate and rectal exams during annual physicals with Bomba.

Matt Weiss, 42, faces 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said Thursday. Weiss was a co-offensive coordinator for the University of Michigan until he was fired in January 2023over allegations he gained unauthorized accessto other people's computer accounts. According to the indictment, Weiss accessed a database managed by a third party that had information on student-athletes from more than 100 colleges and universities across the country. He is alleged to have done so ""through compromising the passwords"" of staff members with elevated access to the database. ""After gaining access to these databases, Weiss downloaded the personally identifiable information (PII) and medical data of more than 150,000 athletes,"" the indictment says. Weiss cracked the encryption protecting the athletes' passwords and conducted further research to ""obtain personal information such as their mothers’ maiden names, pets, places of birth, and nicknames,"" according to the indictment. Using all of that information, Weiss either reset or guessed the passwords of 2,000 students, the indictment says. It alleges he targeted the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of female student-athletes. ""Once he obtained access to the accounts of targeted athletes, Weiss searched for and downloaded personal, intimate photographs and videos that were not publicly shared,"" the indictment says. Weiss was also able to access the private accounts of 1,300 students or alumni who attended institutions around the country, according to the indictment. ""In at least several instances, Weiss exploited vulnerabilities in universities’ account authentication processes to gain access to the accounts of students or alumni,"" the indictment says. Federal court records do not list an attorney for Weiss, and it is unclear whether he is in federal custody. A call to a phone number listed for Weiss was not immediately returned Thursday. The University of Michigan declined to comment on the charges, referring questions to the U.S. attorney's office. Each charge of unauthorized access to computers carries a maximum of five years in federal prison. Conviction on an aggravated identity theft charge comes with a two-year mandatory minimum sentence. Weiss was hired at the University of Michigan in 2021 after 12 seasons as an assistant coach with the Baltimore Ravens, according to his university biography. Before that, he worked at Stanford University. Jim Harbaugh, who now coaches the Los Angeles Chargers, was head football coach at both Stanford and Michigan when Weiss worked there. Harbaugh’s brother, John, has been head coach of the Ravens since 2008 and would also have worked with Weiss. Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

www.nbcnews.com,How will the universe end? A changing understanding of dark energy may provide a new answer,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/dark-energy-changing-understanding-rcna197386,"Scientists are homing in on the nature of amysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. The force is enormous — it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful — it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate. And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether thisdark energyis a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year. Results presentedat a meeting of theAmerican Physical SocietyWednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven’t worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe. The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe’s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around. Called theDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies andquasarslast year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements — exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape — support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning. “It’s moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we’ve thought about cosmology and start over,” said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research. It’s not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including theEuropean Space Agency’s Euclid missionand the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. “We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements” at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research. If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still. If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what’s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. “Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,” he said. “Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don’t know.”",2025-03-22 00:49:24

Welcome to the very final installment of ‘My Dad is Stuck in Space,’ because he’s not anymore,” Daryn Wilmore said in aTikTok videoposted Wednesday. What was planned to be a one week stay on the International Space Station turned into more than nine months after Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams’Boeing Starliner spacecraftexperienced technical issues. The duo splashed down off Florida around 5:57 p.m. ET on Tuesday after spending 286 days on the orbiting station. Sporting a blue Starliner T-shirt, Daryn Wilmore shared her excitement about how she plans to celebrate her long-awaited reunion with her father. “We’re not having a party for him,” Daryn Wilmore said. “We might want to go to my uncle’s house. ... We might just have a little get-together with a few close friends, but no big party or anything. I’m making him his favorite dessert, which is pecan pie.” “I actually have a list that’s all his favorite things and things that we used to do together, to hopefully do them these next few days that he’s here before I go back to school, or just in the coming months that he’s back, just to do what we have loved doing and make up for some lost time,” she added. Now that her father is back on the Earth’s surface, Daryn Wilmore shared what his next steps will be as his body readjusts. “He’s going to spend the next few days going in, tests, lots of medical stuff, because they’re still technically part of the experiment of human spaceflight, and just get re-acclimated to gravity and the routine back here on Earth,” she said. Daryn Wilmore ended her update with a cheeky pitch to filmmakers about her father’s latest adventure. “Hollywood, I think a movie should happen. I think a movie should happen. If you want to call me, I have ideas,” she said. “‘Apollo 13,’ that’s a great movie. But do you know what could even be better?

www.nbcnews.com,"Fired NOAA staffers are reinstated, creating confusion on the heels of severe storms",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/noaa-fired-workers-reinstated-weather-storms-rcna197004,"Workers at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration this week experienced a kind of whiplash as the federal government tried to reinstate probationary employees who had been fired. More than600 NOAA workers were laid off more than two weeks ago, including some in public safety roles, such as scientists who issue tsunami alerts, hurricane-hunting flight directors and meteorologists in local forecast offices. But Thursday,a U.S. district judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order, blocking (at least temporarily) the terminations of tens of thousands of workers across agencies and ordering them to be reinstated. The Trump administration said in court Monday that it had moved to reinstate about 24,000 workers affected by the widespread cuts to the federal government’s probationary workforce. (Probationary workers are typically in their first or second years of federal service, but the status also applies to some employees who were recently promoted or hired full-time after having worked as contractors.) In a court filing, the Commerce Department confirmed that it had reinstated 791 workers, in total, across its agencies, including NOAA. The reinstatements have added a new layer of confusion at NOAA, which had already halted several services because of staffing issues following the cuts. Theyincluded weather balloon launches in Albany, New York; Gray, Maine;andKotzebue, Alaska,that are critical to support accurate forecasting. The agency alsoclosed several offices. The cuts came just weeks before a severe storm raced across the country, spawning tornadoes andkilling at least 42 people. The National Weather Service, a division of NOAA, forecast the storm, issuing public alerts that it would be a “particularly dangerous event.” Although the probationary workers at NOAA have technically been reinstated, they were placed on administrative leave and have not been asked to return to work. So it is not immediately clear whether the services they previously contributed to would be restored. The NOAA press office directed questions to the Commerce Department, which did not respond to a request for comment. Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeling specialist with a doctorate who was laid off late last month, said he received an email Monday with a memorandum confirming he had been reinstated following the court action. “You will be reinstated to the Federal service and your previous position of record, retroactive to the effective date of your termination, and placed in a paid, non-duty status,” the memo said, adding that the situation would remain that way until the court case concludes or the department takes further action. It offered few additional details, except that the Commerce Department “may revert your prior termination action to its original effective date” if a higher court invalidates the restraining order or if the department ultimately wins in court. Hazelton said that as of Monday, he had received no additional communication and remained unsure whether he would receive back pay or eventually return to his duties. The email brought temporary relief, he said, but confusion remains because he has also heard rumors that there may be additional cuts to the NOAA workforce through a reduction in force, or RIF. “I’m glad it might be a step toward getting our jobs back, but it’s still not clear it’s going to be permanent, and there’s still rumors about RIFs,” Hazelton said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and more questions than answers.” Indeed, rumors have circulated widely about possible layoffs at NOAA. At a news conference last week held by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce and other programs, Rick Spinrad, the NOAA administrator during President Joe Biden’s administration, made some details of those rumors public. “NOAA was forced to identify an additional 1,029 positions” for potential termination, Spinrad said, adding that he had been told about the potential cuts by former colleagues still at the agency. Dennis Jaszka, who worked as an investigative support technician for NOAA’s office of law enforcement before he was laid off, said he received an identical email to Hazelton’s. Jaszka, 49, said he now feels “in complete limbo.” He resents the implication that government workers are a drain on taxpayer resources and the statements President Donald Trump has made suggesting that theydo not do good work, or any work at all. “It took me a lot of time to get this job, and then I finally get it, and then this administration comes in and says, basically, ‘You government workers are cockroaches.’ That’s not what they said, but it’s kind of the idea: ‘You just steal our tax money and you don’t do anything,’” Jaszka said. Now, after the court order, Jaszka pointed out, the government has instructed him outright not to report to duty. “‘We’re also willing to pay you not to come to work at all.’ It’s ridiculous,” he said. “Me and a lot of other people love our jobs. We came in believing in the mission of NOAA.” In a court filing, the Commerce Department said it did not ask employees to return to full duty because that would be a burden on the agency and cause turmoil for terminated employees. “All employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,” Jessica Palatka, the department’s chief human capital officer, wrote in a court filing. She added that an appellate court could also reverse the decision and leave employees “subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.” Evan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.",2025-03-22 00:49:29
www.cbsnews.com,"Judge rebukes Justice Dept., raises due process questions in deportation case",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-rebukes-justice-dept-due-process-alien-enemies-act-deportation-case/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:10 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday. ""I made it very clear what you had to do,"" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. ""Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,"" he asked Ensign. The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasbergblockedthe administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction. ""You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around … to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,"" Boasberg said Friday. ""Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?"" ""I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,"" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding. Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. ""It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,"" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was ""essentially signed in the dark"" on Saturday and then the migrants were ""rushed onto planes."" He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, ""had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,"" which Ensign confirmed. The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an ""individualized assessment of their status,"" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, ""What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?"" The Justice Department did not offer a direct response. Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. — and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could. Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch. Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees ""are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process … what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence"" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan? Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive. Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist. ""If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?"" Boasberg asked. Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation. He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis. ""We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,"" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked ""against any gang.""

www.cbsnews.com,U.S. to revoke legal status of more than a half-million migrants,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-to-revoke-legal-status-of-over-a-half-million-migrants-chnv/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:11 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration will be revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Latin American and Haitian migrants welcomed into the U.S. under a Biden-era sponsorship process, urging them to self-deport or face arrest and removal by deportation agents. The termination of their work permits and deportation protections under an immigration authority known as parole will take effect in late April, 30 days after March 25,according to a noticeposted by the federal government. The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program,known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues. A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally. CBS Newsfirst reportedin early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process. The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation. But DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card. In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV process were ""loosely vetted,"" and argued the program undercut American workers. ""The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,"" McLaughlin added.

www.cbsnews.com,"Trump revokes security clearances of Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-revokes-security-clearances-of-kamala-harris-hillary-clinton-and-other-prominent-dems/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 11:27 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump on Friday night rescinded the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, several members of the Biden administration, and other prominent Democrats. The move comes after Mr. Trump had alreadyannounced last monththat he was revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance. In a memo Friday, the president said he was also rescinding the security clearances of the entire Biden family. Also losing their access to classified information and their security clearances were former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, New York Attorney General Letita James, Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, former White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Rep. Elizabeth Cheney, former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen, and attorney Mark Zaid,who was a lawyerfor the whistleblower who reported concerns about the Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine in his first White House term. Several of those named, including James and Bragg,had already had their clearances revokedearlier this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a purge of dozens of clearances for current and former officials. Friday's memo applies to ""receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress."" Since taking office in January, the president has revoked the clearances of multiple former officials who he claims ""weaponized"" either the intelligence community or the law against him. Cheney and Kinzinger helped leadthe House select committee investigationinto the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Bragg brought the New York ""hush money"" criminal case which resulted in a felony conviction for Mr. Trump on34 state countsof falsification of business records. James sued Mr. Trump and the Trump organization, accusing them of widespread fraud. The lengthy trialresulted in a judge's $453 million verdictagainst Mr. Trump and his former company. Those who had previously had their clearances revoked includeretired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Trump and Biden administrations and had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over thephoto opin front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House. Mr. Trump was also critical of Milley's revelation that he had engaged in two phone calls — one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second onJan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection — with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable. On the day of his inauguration, Mr. Trumprevokedthe clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming that emails found on a laptop owned by Biden's son, Hunter, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Mr. Trump's first term, also had his clearance pulled over a book he penned about his time in the role. The president accused Bolton of publishing sensitive information and said the book's publication ""created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.""

www.cbsnews.com,"George Foreman, boxing legend and entrepreneur, dies at 76",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boxing-george-foreman-dies-76/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 11:29 PM EDT/ CBS/AP George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion turned business entrepreneur who was part of some of the sport's most memorable matches and moments, died Friday at the age of 76, his family announced. ""Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones,"" Foreman's family announced on Instagram. ""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,"" his family continued in the post. No cause of death was given. ""George was a great friend to not only myself but to my entire family. We've lost a family member and are absolutely devastated,"" Top Rank president Bob Arum said in astatement. Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas, but grew up in Houston's Fifth Ward, and was raised alongside his six siblings by a single mother. Foreman was open about his troublesome childhood. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and became a""mugger and brawler."" An Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion, Foreman competed between 1967 and 1997. He learned to box at age 16, won Olympic gold at 19. He stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!"" In 1974, he tried to defend his title in Zaire in one of the most famous fights in history. The ""Rumble in the Jungle,"" against Muhammad Ali. Foreman described the fight toCBS Morningsin 2016 as a ""strange"" experience. ""I thought I'd knock him out in one or two rounds, but about the third round, I'd hit him, and he fell on me. I thought, 'That's it.' And he started screaming, 'That all you got, George?! Show me something!' And I knew then I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he said at the time. Foreman said he and Ali, who died in 2016, became lifelong friends after the fight. Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade as a preacher after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a title fight in 1991. In 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer and became the oldest world champion in boxing history at 45 years old. Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023. Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman. ""Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. ""His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

www.cbsnews.com,"Dismantling Education Department could cause chaos, experts warn",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-education-department-executive-order-student-loan/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 4:57 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process ofdismantling the Department of Educationcould throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts. The Education Department'sremit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid. ""It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,"" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. ""It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have."" Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department ""will be much smaller than it is today."" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants. Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans. ""I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,"" Mr. Trump said. Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA. ""Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them — we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,"" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. ""We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition."" Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress — a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass. Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties. ""It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,"" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio."" Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight ""is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,"" he said. ""It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program."" The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. ""The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,"" Thompson said. She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. ""We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,"" Thompson said. That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults. ""Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,"" she said. ""[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,"" Granville added.

DHS said the offices ""often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations."" Migrant Insider was first to report the decision. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties advises the department on civil liberties and rights matters, while investigating and addressing complaints. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman helps filers with complaints about potential violations of immigration detention standards or about DHS or contract personnel. And the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman assists both employers and individuals with issues they may be having with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission,"" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations."" ""DHS remains committed to civil rights protections but must streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement. These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department's core mission: border security and immigration enforcement."" This is a developing story and will be updated.

www.cbsnews.com,Judge shares video disassembling guns in chambers in dissent against ruling,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-lawrence-vandyke-california-guns-video/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 5:06 PM EDT/ CBS News An appellate judge shared a video of himself disassembling multiple firearms in an unusual dissent against the court's decision to uphold California's ban on gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. During the video, Judge Lawrence VanDyke of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said his colleagues have a ""basic misunderstanding of how firearms work."" Throughoutthe 18-minute video, VanDyke said large-capacity magazines should be covered under the Second Amendment. He argued that the magazines can allow the gun to function better, and should be considered functional parts, not accessories. He said he had planned to voice his arguments in his dissent but found it ""obviously much more effective to simply show you."" He stated that the guns featured in the video were inoperable for safety reasons. His colleagues on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a law banning large-capacity gun magazines was allowed under the Second Amendment, finding in a 7-4 decision that large-capacity magazines are not considered ""arms"" or ""protected accessories."" The dissenting judges, including VanDyke, wrote that magazines holding more than 10 rounds are ""the most common magazines in the country"" and are sold with most guns. In herconcurrence with the ruling, Judge Marsha Berzon criticized VanDyke's video, saying that he had ""in essence appointed himself as an expert witness in the case"" and provided ""a factual presentation with the express aim of convincing the readers of his view of the facts without complying with any of the procedural safeguards that usually apply to experts and their testimony, while simultaneously serving on the panel deciding the case."" Berzon also called it ""wildly improper"" and said it should be commented on ""lest the genre proliferate."" VanDyke was nominated by President Trump during his first term andconfirmedin December 2019. The Senate confirmed him in a 51-44 vote. Kerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

www.cbsnews.com,Investors are taking cover as economic concerns grow,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/today-stock-market-down-news-trump-tariffs-3-21-2025/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 4:28 PM EDT/ CBS News Stocks closed in the green, eking out a small gain Friday and snapping a four-week losing streak. After opening sharply lower, leading indexes moved higher in afternoon trading, buoyed by President Trump suggesting he's willing to be flexible as the U.S. negotiates over tariffs with trading partners. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex each ended up 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%. The reversal amounts to a break from the recent gloom that has settled over financial markets. Investors have pulled back as theygauge the potential risksfrom the Trump administration's trade and immigration policies, as well as forecasts for slower U.S. economic growth. ""This is a very uncertain time,"" said Christopher Low of FHN Financial. ""There's a tendency to worry, and worry translates into selling."" The Federal Reserve on Wednesday predicted that the nation's gross domestic product this yearwould fall to 1.7%, a sharp decline from 2.8% in 2024. Policymakers also expect inflation to edge up in 2025 before abating the following year. For now, by contrast, the odds of a recession remain low, according to the central bank. ""I expect GDP growth this year to step down from last year's pace in part because of a slowdown in labor force growth due to lower immigration rates,"" John Williams, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in aspeechFriday. One indication the economy is losing speed — FedEx shares sank 10% Friday after it warned the previous day that its revenues are flattening and lowered its profit guidance. The delivery giant, along with rival UPS, is seen as a measure of broader economic activity. Other company earnings also have disappointed. ""High borrowing costs and elevated economic policy uncertainty will lead to business investment stagnating this year. Survey measures of investment intentions have fallen sharply in response to the threats of tariffs and spending cuts,"" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a report Friday. Leading market indexes have slumped in recent weeks after reaching record highs in February, and Wall Street analysts expect trading to remain choppy. One key potential catalyst will come on April 2, when U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with so-called reciprocal tariffs on other countries, are set to take effect. A survey of money managers from Bank of America this week showed that institutional investors arepulling out of U.S. equitiesin favor of more stable geographic regions. Even generally bullish market analysts are striking a note of caution given the mounting uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's economic policies. ""We continue to bet on the resilience of the consumer, the economy and corporate earnings, but we reckon that heightened recession fears will weigh on valuation multiples,"" Ed Yardeni, president of investment adviser Yardeni Research, told investors in a note. ""We acknowledge that the risks of a recession and a bear market might continue to increase. It all depends on the often-unpredictable President, who frequently — and proudly — has referred to himself as 'Tariff Man,' reflecting his strong support for protectionist trade policies.""

""The U.S. saw China gunning down its own citizens and then also successfully covering it up afterwards,"" RFA President Bay Fang told CBS News. ""The U.S. Congress created us with an eye to giving these people in China and other authoritarian countries around Asia the ability to have free press, to get access to the truth through an unbiased news service."" Fang put 75% of RFA staff on leave Friday, the result of funding cuts ordered byKari Lake, senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of RFA andVoice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster. Last weekend, all full-time employees and contractors with VOAwere informedthey were being placed on administrative leave, while Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were notified that federal grants for both broadcasters had been terminated. ""USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law,"" the agency said in a March 15 statement. Lake, a former television broadcaster who ran unsuccessful Republican governor and Senate campaigns in Arizona,had beeninitially tapped by President Trump to serve as VOA director before taking on the role of senior adviser to USAGM. RFA had a full-time staff of about 400 people prior to the layoffs, according toits website. It also had another approximately 500 stringers and contractors. At least eight RFA journalists could be forced to leave the U.S. if they lose their work visas. Vietnamese journalist Khoa Lai is one of them and fears the possibility of being deported. ""I believe so, but I hope not,"" Lai said. ""I believe that if I go back, then the government will snatch me right away."" Five people who worked for RFA are already behind bars overseas. RFA funds their families and their legal defense. ""These are not U.S. citizens, but they are people who are in jail because they worked for a U.S.- funded network,"" Fang said. RFA's stated mission is to provide fair, objective and uncensored news and information to Asian nations where there are few, if any, free speech protections. ""We're worth saving because we actually bring benefit to the U.S. taxpayer,"" Fang said. ""I think it is in the U.S. national security interest to have something like us. We are actually one of the lowest cost-effective elements of soft power that they could have."" RFA told CBS News that unless the courts, Congress or a private financier steps in, it only has enough money to continue broadcasting for approximately one more month.

www.cbsnews.com,"Columbia University announces mask ban, hiring of special officers",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/columbia-university-mask-ban-trump-administration-demands/,"Updated on:  March 22, 2025 / 12:30 AM EDT/ CBS New York Columbia University has announced a new mask ban, the hiring of special officers and other new policies, some of which are in line withthe Trump administration's demands. Thursday markedthe deadline that the Trump administration gave Columbiato comply with its list of demands before even discussingthe $400 million in funding that the federal government pulleddue to what it called the school's failure to protect students from antisemitism. ""Our response to the government agencies outlines the substantive work we've been doing over the last academic year to advance our mission, ensure uninterrupted academic activities, and make every student, faculty, and staff member safe and welcome on our campus,"" Interim President Katrina Armstrong wrote in an email to students Friday. One of the new policiesis a ban on face masks or coverings intended to conceal an individual's identity. However, the policy says, ""Face masks or face coverings are always allowed for religious or medical reasons."" Additionally, anyone participating in a protest or demonstration on campus must present their university ID if asked by a university delegate or public safety officer. The school is also hiring 36 new special officers who will have the ability to remove people from campus or arrest them, if needed. ""Those individuals are near completion of their training and credentialing under New York law to work on our campus,"" the policy says in part. ""While we train and credential our internal security force, we will continue to rely on our relationship with the NYPD to provide additional security assistance when needed."" There are also changes to the disciplinary process, including moving the university judicial board under the purview of the president's office. There's also a new Office of Institutional Equity with 57 fulltime staff to investigate discrimination complaints. The university will also appoint a new senior vice provost to review its educational programs relating to Middle Eastern studies. Armstrong says the review will work to ensure educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced. Columbia is also going to review its admission procedures and make recommendations on how to ensure unbiased admission processes. The interim president says the office will adopt a position of institutional neutrality and will establish an institution-wide policy implementing that stance. It's unclear if the Trump administration will now reinstate that $400 million in federal grants and funding. Though Columbia wants the money back, some students are asking, at what cost? ""It's never the place of the government to really do these things,"" student Yousif Elhaj said. ""I think it's kind of honestly disgraceful, to be quite honest,"" student Landon Pottebaum said. ""Because Columbia has such a long reputation, long history of being this protest school and kind of not wavering in the face of federal action and kind of letting the students act on their own, so I think this is just an act of cowardice, quite honestly."" In its letter, the Department of Education had said compliance with their demands was a prerequisite to discussing the school's financial relationship with the federal government.

www.cbsnews.com,Wife of detained Columbia University student gives first TV interview,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mahmoud-khalil-wife-noor-abdalla-on-his-arrest-by-ice-agents/,"March 21, 2025 / 1:00 PM EDT/ CBS News When federal immigration officials confronted Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil inside his New York City apartment building earlier this month, his wife, Noor Abdalla, assumed it was a misunderstanding. She rushed upstairs to their apartment to get documents proving he was a U.S. green card holder. ""My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that,"" Abdalla described during an interview with Erin Moriarty for""CBS Sunday Morning""airing on Sunday. It's the first sit-down TV interview Abdalla has given since her husband's arrest on March 8. Videoreleased by the ACLU last week shows Khalil's arrest after helping lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University's campus. In the video, which is 8 minutes long, you can see Khalil being handcuffed as he's told to stop resisting. He's heard reassuring his wife, ""Baby, it's fine,"" as he tells the agents that he'll go with them. ""I was scared. I was terrified,"" Abdalla said of her husband's nighttime arrest. But Abdalla, who is 8 months pregnant and an American citizen, still believed he would be taken into immigration custody at Federal Plaza in Manhattan and released within hours after officials saw his paperwork. ""People keep telling me like, 'Oh, you were so calm in the video. I would have been freaking out,'"" Abdalla said. ""For me, I think the reason I was so calm was because I was like, this is just a misunderstanding. They're going to take him away, to 26 Federal Plaza, see that he has a green card, he'll be home in a few hours."" She never imagined the 30-year-old would be taken from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement     field office in Lower Manhattan to the Elizabeth Detention Center in Elizabeth, N.J., where, according to published remarks by Khalil, he slept on the ground, and was refused a blanket despite his request. He was then transferred to Louisiana. A federal judge temporarily blocked Khalil's removal from the U.S., barring the government from deporting him before a hearing could be held. Lawyers for the Trump administration have asked that legal issues be addressed by federal judges in New Jersey or Louisiana rather than New York, where Khalil was arrested. On WednesdayJudge Jesse Furman ruledthat the case should be heard in New Jersey, where Khalil's petition challenging the government was filed. In hisfirst public remarks, Khalil called himself a ""political prisoner"" and warned that other ""visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs."" In a letter dictated by Khalil from detention in Louisiana, he said that his only concern at the time of his arrest was for the safety of his wife.

www.cbsnews.com,"In U.S. auto market, uncertainty reigns over the potential impact of tariffs",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-auto-market-car-prices-uncertainty-reigns-trump-tariffs/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:30 PM EDT/ CBS News Los Angeles— With a 25% tariff onimported vehicles and vehicle partsfrom Canada and Mexico set to take effect on April 2 as part of President Trump's trade wars, car shoppers are unsure about whether to buy now orrisk facing higher prices later. Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles. Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change. ""It's tough to say,"" Wishengrad said. ""At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does."" The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare. ""A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,"" Caldwell explained. ""…If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American."" Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issueda one-month reprieveto U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he alsoissued a pauseuntil Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Caldwell says that she suspects that in ""many cases"" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them. ""Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,"" Caldwell added. She notes that while automakers ""can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time."" In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.""It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,"" Caldwell said. When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear.""So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,"" Caldwell said. ""We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution."" Wishengrad agrees that the back-and-forth about the trade war has become white noise for consumers. ""I do think so, eventually, you know, people start to tune that out.""

www.cbsnews.com,London's Heathrow Airport resumes some flights after huge power cut,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heathrow-airport-london-closes-power-outage/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 9:56 PM EDT/ CBS News London'sHeathrow Airport— one of the busiest airports in the world — resumed some flights after being closed for most of Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. An estimated 200,000 travelers were affected by the shutdown. The first plane landed around 6:30 p.m. local time, the Associated Press reported. ""We're running all flights as scheduled, including additional flights to support with reconnecting passengers and repositioning aircraft,"" a statement on Heathrow's website read early Saturday morning. British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow,saideight long-haul flights were cleared to depart Friday evening. The airport said the fire late Thursday night at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a ""significant power outage,"" but on Friday afternoon, an airport spokesperson said teams had ""worked tirelessly since the incident to ensure a speedy recovery"" and that the facility was ""safely able to begin some flights later today."" After the announcement, at least one plane could be seen taxiing. ""Please do not travel to the airport unless your airline has advised you to do so,"" the statement said. ""We will now work with the airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe. We hope to run a full operation tomorrow and will provide further information shortly."" The spokesperson noted that, ""as the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time."" Heathrow had initially said no flights would go in or out until the end of Friday, warning that it expected ""significant disruption over the coming days."" At around 9 p.m. local time on Friday, approximately 5% of the fire near the airport was still burning, the London Fire Brigade said. London's Metropolitan Police said there was ""currently no indication of foul play,"" but that counterterrorism police would lead the investigation into the substation fire that shut downEurope's busiest airport. The London Fire Brigade said Friday that the fire was believed to be ""non-suspicious"" and that its investigation will ""now focus on the electrical distribution equipment."" ""Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,"" the police said in a statement. Tracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport.British Airwayshad earlier said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the ""next 24 hours and beyond."" The FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week. ""I saw the time on the screen started to increase,"" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner networkBBC News. ""I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'"" Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York. The impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands of passengers forced to find alternate travel plans. ""We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,"" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to ""a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption"" in 2010 that shut down European airspace. ""Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,"" Strickland told the AP. Britain's National Rail servicecanceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police. The London Fire Brigadesaid10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was ""under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day."" The power outage affected ""a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,"" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in astatement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a social media post that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes, but by Friday afternoon, the National Grid power distributor said the network had ""been reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to"" the substation in Hayes. ""This is an interim solution while we carry out further work,"" National Grid said, adding: ""We are continuing to work closely with all stakeholders to manage this incident, and are focused on returning to normal resilience levels as soon as possible."" Authorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but local residents reported hearing explosions. ""I was about 100 yards from the explosion,"" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when ""suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook."" ""When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,"" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house. ""When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook."" ""We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,"" U.K. energy secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC earlier Friday. Thelatest numbersfrom travel data provider OAG Aviation show Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world this month. Earlier this year,it reportedits busiest January on record, serving over 6.3 million passengers and averaging over 200,000 passengers a day. More than 1.2 million of those passengers traveled between the U.K. and the U.S. The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

www.cbsnews.com,Small Business Administration cutting staff by 43%,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/small-business-administration-40-percent-staff-cuts/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 12:02 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The Small Business Administration on Friday said it is cutting more than 40% of its staff as part of the Trump administration'swider effortto shrink the federal bureaucracy. Roughly 6,500 people, or less than half-a-percent of the entire federal workforce, are employed at the SBA, according to the most recent data available. The agency said in astatementthat it will ""reduce its workforce by 43%"" and said the cuts would save more than $435 million a year by next fiscal year. ""The strategic reorganization will begin a turnaround for the agency by restoring the efficiency of the first Trump Administration, as well as its focus on promoting small businesses,"" the agency said. ""Core services to the public, including the agency's loan guarantee and disaster assistance programs, as well as its field and veteran operations, will not be impacted."" The Senate voted to confirm former Sen. Kelly Loeffler to as the agency's administrator in February. In avideoposted to X on Friday, Loeffler said it's time to ""rightsize the agency."" ""Since the pandemic, the SBA has doubled its workforce, expanding in size, scope and spending with miserable results,"" Loeffler said in the video. ""That's why change is coming to the SBA. ... This agency is done wasting millions of tax dollars to fund a progressive pandemic-era bureaucracy. We will not allow fiscal mismanagement to threaten our loan programs or criminals to get away with fraud. But we will evaluate every program and expenditure and we will rightsize the agency to transform the SBA into a high-efficiency engine for America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers."" Staff is spread out in district offices across the country. Texas has more SBA employees than any state, including the District of Columbia, where the agency is headquartered. Speaking at the White House on Friday morning, President Trump announced that SBA will be responsible for handling federal student loan programs, one day after signing an order to beginwinding down the Department of Education, which currently manages the programs. Expertswarnedthat the order could throw student loans into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers. Administration officials have previously said that student loan programs would eventually be transferred to an agency like the SBA or the Treasury or Commerce Departments. The SBA was established by an act of Congress in 1953 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president to ""aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns."" It provides loans to businesses that fall victim to natural disasters and offers support on international trade issues. The agency's federally backed loans and grants were a lifeline to small businesses and nonprofit groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Arden Farhicontributed to this report.

www.cbsnews.com,"Spring allergies are here, and this map shows which cities could be hit hard",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/allergy-season-cities-2025/,"March 21, 2025 / 2:24 PM EDT/ CBS News Springis here — and with it comes allergy season. Each year, more than 100 million people in the U.S. experience allergies, including seasonalpollen allergies. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has releasedits annual reportfor 2025, ranking the most challenging U.S. cities for those dealing withseasonal allergies. The report ranks the top 100 U.S. cities based on pollen levels, over-the-counterallergy medicationuse and access to allergists. For three years in a row, Wichita, Kansas, ranks as the most challenging city for pollen allergies. Cities in the South and East are among the hardest hit. New Orleans, which ranked 34th last year, jumped to second place this year due to a surge in weed pollen, likely from moisture fromHurricane Francine, which made landfall back in September.  Also, November 2024 was the warmest on record in Louisiana, and the warmer temperatures extended the growing season. Several cities that ranked ""better than average"" were mostly in the Northeast, where pollen typically peaks in the fall season. However, a2024 droughtmay have reduced weed pollen levels, according to the report. Boston was ranked as the least challenging city for allergies, likely due to its low pollen and high number of allergists. Even though the most challenging cities were concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the country, the West saw some changes. For example, wet weather in California ""increased grass and weed pollen counts in 2024 compared to 2023,"" according to the report. This caused several cities to jump in rankings. The increased pollen counts may be ""due to an abundance ofatmospheric riversin 2024 that particularly impacted Central and Southern California but brought much of the state to near or above normal precipitation levels,"" Hannah Jaffee, research director for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, said in an email. Withclimate patternsshifting, seasons arestarting earlier and lasting longerbecause ofclimate change. In some regions, tree, grass or weed pollen is present year-round. Additionally,warmer temperaturestrap heatin urban areas, increasing air pollution and increasing pollen production, according to the report. Rich Lucas, chief data officer atPollen Sense, analyzed pollen data correlated with large weather events and found cities showed pollen spikes around the weather. For example, in Boise, Idaho, tree pollen levels increased significantly in 2023 and 2024. This was likely due to above-average snowfall in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, providing moisture for tree growth and increasing pollen. Weeds in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, surged in the fall of 2024. Storms removed ground cover, allowing weeds to quickly recolonize and grow in the moist conditions. In Tampa, Florida, weed levels were sporadic in the fall of 2024, affected by threenamed storms. Both weeds and grass responded to the fluctuations and added moisture and recovery time between storms. The high tree pollen peak was not present in December 2024 because the cedar pollen season did not start until January 2025. Pollen production in Poughkeepsie, New York, decreased in 2024, likely due to drought conditions in the Northeast, which reduced tree pollen output. If the city you live in is ranked poorly, Jaffee offered some advice. ""Before you pack up your things and move, it's important to remember that there are many available and accessible options to help you find allergy relief no matter where you live,"" she said. Here are some steps you can take to lessen allergy symptoms: Jaffee mentioned that an allergy specialist can help with finding a treatment plan that works for your specific allergy situation.

www.cbsnews.com,"Idaho murders suspect selfie puts focus on ""bushy eyebrows"" evidence",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/idaho-murders-suspect-bryan-kohberger-selfie-evidence-bushy-eyebrows/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 7:37 AM EDT/ CBS/AP A flurry of court documents filed this week in the case ofBryan Kohberger, the man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in late 2022, offers new details about how the case against him is shaping up. Among thosedocumentsrevealed by prosecutors is what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone just hours after the killings. Kohberger, 30, is accused in thestabbing deathsof Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, wasarrested in Pennsylvaniaweeks after the killings. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene. A defense attorney pushed to have the DNA evidence thrown out, but Judge Steven Hipplerdenied that request last month. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of murder in the Nov. 13, 2022 stabbing. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty if he is convicted. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. The killings shook the small farming community of about 25,000 people, which hadn't had a homicide in about five years. The trial was moved from rural northern Idaho to Boise after the defense expressed concerns that Kohberger couldn't get a fair trial in the county where the killings occurred. The newly filed documents include pretrial motions that will shape what evidence and expert testimony will be allowed at Kohberger's trial, which is set tobegin Aug. 11and expected to last more than three months. They show that prosecutors intend to introduce evidence of Kohberger's ""click history"" at Amazon.com showing hepurchased a Ka-Bar knife— a military-style, fixed-blade knife — along with a sheath and sharpener in March, eight months before the killings. A Ka-Bar knife was found next to one of the victims. Further, prosecutors say, the Amazon click history also shows Kohberger searched for a Ka-Bar knife in the days after the killings. ""Kohberger's click activity after the homicides makes it more probable (than it would be without the evidence) that Kohberger had a reason to search for a Ka-Bar knife and sheath after the homicides,"" prosecutors wrote. Kohberger's attorneyshave sought to exclude the online shopping history, saying it could be taken out of context or not reflect the influence of algorithms that recommend purchases. Prosecutors say they also intend to introduce what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone at 10:31 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 — just hours after the killings. In it, he is smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture. Aroommatewho was in the rental home, sleeping and intoxicated, told police she woke up and saw a man she didn't know — someone with ""bushy eyebrows"" who was wearing a face mask. Defense attorneys have asked the judge to exclude from the trial any description of the attacker having bushy eyebrows, saying that could prejudice the jury. ""If evidence of 'bushy eyebrows' is presented to the jury, the jury might well believe that Mr. Kohberger is guilty simply because of 'bushy eyebrows,'"" defense attorneys wrote. But prosecutors say the roommate's description is credible, and they want to introduce Kohberger's selfie because it shows his appearance shortly after the killings. ""Whether or not Bryan Kohberger can be described as having 'bushy eyebrows' is a factual determination to be decided by the jury,"" they wrote. Prosecutors have also presented a map that illustrates the locations where Kohberger's car was allegedly seen on surveillance video on the night of the murders, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reported. Judge Hippler has scheduled a hearing for April 9 to consider the pretrial motions. Among those to be decided are arguments over whether an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis would preclude Kohberger from being eligible for the death penalty if convicted, and over whether jurors should hearaudio of a 911 callmade by two women in the house roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up. The court has issued a gag order for everyone involved in the trial and won't allow cameras in the courtroom. Other motions have been filed ahead of the trial, including a sealed defense motion to take thedeath penaltyoff the table that cited autism spectrum disorder. Other sealed motions include one on whether theterms ""psychopath"" or ""sociopath""can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial. Last November, Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, said the details of the case show thedeath penaltyis merited. ""You've got four victims, all in one house — that's more than enough,"" Steve Goncalves said. Kristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter. ""If he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,"" she said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

www.cbsnews.com,When and where to see D.C.'s iconic cherry blossoms,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-dc-cherry-blossoms-peak-bloom-maps/,"March 21, 2025 / 3:41 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington, D.C.'s iconiccherry blossomsare getting closer to the 2025 peak bloom. Thousands of trees with white and pink flowers circle the Tidal Basin and parks near some of the capital's famous monuments and memorials. Here's what to know about when and where to see the cherry trees in bloom. Peak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees, the most common type along the Tidal Basin, are open. The National Park Service, which tracks the blooming of the trees each year,predicts peak bloomwill be between March 28 and 31 this year. Based on over 100 years of data, theaverage peak bloomdate is April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms. Since 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the EPA says. As of March 20, the officialfirst day of spring, 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin reached the fourth stage in their blooming, which is peduncle elongation, according to the National Park Service. There is one more stage, puffy blossoms, before peak bloom. Alive cameraprovided by the Trust for the National Mall offers viewers a chance to check the status of some of the blossoms. The most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park. This year, construction that began in August 2024 toreplace seawallsalong the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026. However, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C.Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, providesa mapof where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said. The Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time. ""Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms,"" the agency said on itswebsite. ""A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all."" Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship. That year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes ina history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas. But the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service. Despite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.

www.cbsnews.com,Here's the West Wing seating chart — whose offices are closest to Trump?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-white-house-seating-chart/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 6:26 PM EDT/ CBS News The senior adviser with the West Wing office closest to the action — the Oval Office — in President Trump's second term is Dan Scavino, one of his longest-serving inner circle aides. Influence with the president of the United States has often been a factor in the physical proximity of an adviser's office to the Oval, but it may matter less in Mr. Trump's second term, when he keeps tabs by phone with the power players whose insights he values most. But the seating chart in the West Wing, which still has some empty desks, still remains a source of intrigue for players inside and outside the White House, people familiar with the layout told CBS News. Scavino occupies the office next to the president's private dining room, the spot Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner used during the first term and Mike Donilon had during Joe Biden's presidency. Scavino, the voice of Trump's MAGA movement whose social media followers who hang on every short video and comment he posts, is now deputy chief of staff. Next to Scavino, in the officeSteve Bannonused during his seven months as chief strategist the first Trump administration, is James Blair, a deputy chief of staff who served as political director for Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign. Susie Wileshas the roomy corner spot that anchors the suite that has traditionally been the chief of staff's. Also in the power hallway is Beau Harrison, deputy chief of staff for operations. He's in the cubicle-like office Biden adviser Bruce Reed sat in. Technically, the desk with the least real estate between it and the Trump's Oval belongs to Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications adviser. She's in the outer Oval with Chamberlain Harris, a receptionist; Natalie Harp, a former One America News Network anchor who played a body-man role during the campaign; and Walt Nauta, a military aide and presidential valet who was accused of obstructing the government's efforts in an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago. The charges were dismissed by federal courts weeks into Mr. Trump's second term. Along the western hallway in the West Wing, in the usual placement for their respective offices, are Vice President JD Vance and national security adviserMike Waltz. Vance's chief of staff Jacob Reses is in the VP's suite. Alex Wong, deputy national security adviser; and senior adviser Micah Ketchel are in Waltz's suite. Brian McCormack, the National Security Council chief of staff, and spokesperson Brian Hughes are on the ground floor, not far from the Situation Room, while most of the rest of the NSC staff are in the building next door, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Border czar Tom Homan is down near the Navy Mess. Also on the basement level are special envoySteve Witkoff, the faith office's Paula White-Cain and the staff secretary, Will Scharf. One of Mr. Trump's top advisers, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, is in a suite upstairs along with policy strategist May Davis Mailman. David Warrington and the White House counsel offices are on the second level, as is Alina Habba, counselor to the president. Down the hall on the second floor are Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council; deputy chief of staff Nick Luna; Vince Haley, who heads the domestic policy council; and head speechwriter Ross Worthington. Other key players on the main floor near the Oval are Taylor Budowich, deputy chief of staff for communications and cabinet affairs, in the most spacious press office; communications director Steven Cheung; press secretaryKaroline Leavittand, in the area known as lower press, Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary. Some of the heaviest hitters in the president's orbit don't have West Wing offices, including cabinet secretaries such as Commerce's Howard Lutnick and government efficiency aideElon Musk, who has an office in the EEOB. And some of his advisers aren't in government, including members of his family, his personal senior counselBoris Epshteynand former communications aide Jason Miller.

www.cbsnews.com,"Trump announces 6th-generation fighter jet, the F-47",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-f-47-boeing-contract/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 1:30 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— President Trump on Friday announced that the U.S. Air Force is moving ahead with asixth-generation fighter jetknown as the F-47, with Boeingbeing awarded the contractto manufacture the new aircraft. ""At my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet,"" the president said alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in an Oval Office announcement. ""Nothing in the world comes even close to it. And it will be known as the F-47."" Boeing and Lockheed Martin had been in competition to build the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, as the U.S. looks to stay ahead of China when it comes to air defense technology. The president said the F-47 is ""the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built,"" calling it ""virtually unseeable"" with ""unprecedented power"" and excellent maneuverability. Mr. Trump said a ""an experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation."" ""America's enemies will never see it coming, hopefully we won't have to use it for that purpose, but you have to have it,"" Mr. Trump said.

Ohio State defeated Notre Dame 34–23on Jan. 20 to claim the College Football Playoff national title. The team is scheduled to meet with President Trump on April 14, according to sources familiar with the visit. Mr. Trump did not attend the championship game, which took place on the day of his inauguration but appeared in a pre-recorded message that aired during halftime on ESPN. ""This has been a historic and exciting day,"" Mr. Trump said in the video, referencing his swearing-in as the 47th president of the United States. ""In recent years, our people have suffered greatly but starting now we're going to bring America back and make it safer, richer, prouder than ever before."" The visit comes as Ohio State is amongmore than 50 universitiesunder investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for alleged racial discrimination. The probe is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to challenge diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs it argues disadvantage white and Asian American students, according to The Associated Press. In a memorandum issued earlier this year, the department warned academic institutions that receive federal funding that they could face penalties for ""race-based preferences"" in admissions, scholarships and other programs.

www.cbsnews.com,White House rescinds order targeting law firm after $40 million pledge,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-weiss-executive-order-rescinded-white-house-trump/,"March 21, 2025 / 9:50 AM EDT/ AP Washington— President Trump on Thursday rescinded anexecutive ordertargeting a prominent international law firm after it pledged to review its hiring practices and to provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives. The move follows a meeting between Mr. Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton, over the White House order issued last week. The order, the latest in a series of similar actionstargeting law firmswhose lawyers have provided legal work that Mr. Trump disagrees with, threatened to suspend active security clearances of attorneys at Paul, Weiss and to terminate any federal contracts the firm has. It singled out the work ofMark Pomerantz, who previously worked at the firm and who oversaw an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office into Mr. Trump's finances before Mr. Trump became president. To avoid those consequences, the White House said Paul, Weiss had agreed to ""take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society,"" to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions and to dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in free legal services to support Trump administration policies on issues including assistance for veterans and countering anti-Semitism. In a statement issued by the White House, Karp said: ""We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss.

www.cbsnews.com,Health agencies brace for layoffs with RFK Jr.'s restructuring of HHS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-nih-hhs-layoffs-doge-rfk-jr-restructuring/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:22 PM EDT/ CBS News Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department. Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement. The department did not respond to a request for comment. In addition to the formal head of the White House'sDepartment of Government Efficiencyteam,Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE areHHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executiveBrad Smith, who was a topMedicareandMedicaidofficial during the first Trump administration. The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and ""reduction-in-force"" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, likeearlier attemptsto purge thousands ofprobationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements. Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut. The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, includingdecades-old datasetstracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on. AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like aprogramaimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria. ""The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,"" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database onmedical spending. At theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go. Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federalrecordsshow, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration. ""A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,"" one CDC official said. Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, underoffers madeacross HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both. Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department. Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at theFood and Drug Administrationwere told they were ineligible to take up the HHSbuyout offer. That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers. Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts. DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week. Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said. Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms. From the workforce at theNational Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration. More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year. Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both. One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures. Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration. The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicyreportedin November. There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019. One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff. Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts. Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedydenouncing reportsthat half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs. The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration. The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted inmore than 10%of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.

www.cbsnews.com,Netanyahu dismisses Israeli domestic intelligence chief,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/netanyahu-dismisses-israeli-domestic-intelligence-chief-ronen-bar/,"March 20, 2025 / 9:19 PM EDT/ AFP The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, was dismissed Friday, according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Netanyahu last week cited an ""ongoing lack of trust"" as the reason for moving to sack Ronen Bar, who was appointed in October 2021 for a five-year term. His firing was unanimously approved by Israel's cabinet. ""The Government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office,"" a statement said. Bar, meant to end his tenure only next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022. His relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented Hamas attack onOctober 7, 2023, which sparkedthe war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country. Relations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack. It acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said ""a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup."" Bar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack. © 2025 AFP. All Rights Reserved.

www.cbsnews.com,"Israel threatens ""complete destruction"" of Gaza for Hamas' crimes",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-gaza-netzarim-corridor-hamas-war-threat-palestinians-collective-punishment/,"Updated on:  March 20, 2025 / 8:28 PM EDT/ CBS News Tel Aviv —Israel's defense minister threatened earlier this week to open ""the gates of hell"" inGazaif Hamas refuses to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demands, and Israel has been delivering. At least 58 people were killed in a third consecutive night ofairstrikes up and down the Palestinian territory, bringing the death toll to an estimated 500 people since theceasefire was shatteredwith Tuesday's shock pre-dawn Israeli missile barrages, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. More than a dozen people were killed overnight in a strike on just one house, the home of the Mubarak family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They had gathered to mourn an earlier death. Survivors whisked the bodies of the dead to a hospital by ambulance and horse cart. There were reports of fresh airstrikes early Thursday morning near Khan Younis and Rafah in the south of Gaza, near the border with Egypt. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed Tuesday that it had also resumed ground operations in central Gaza, again dividing the strip into north and south along the Netzarim corridor and blocking movement across the line. The IDF said it was also stationing a brigade of troops in the south, while airdropping fliers warning civilians to evacuate from areas around the entire Gaza border, which it warned would be turned back into combat zones. ""The IDF does not intend to harm you,"" a post by the IDF spokesman for Arab Media said on X. ""For your safety it is forbidden to approach IDF forces in the defensive zone and in any place where they are deployed."" That message followed a severe threat from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to the citizens of Gaza. ""Residents of Gaza, this is a final warning,"" he said in a video broadcast Wednesday afternoon. ""If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not eliminated from Gaza Israel will act with forces you have never known before. Take the advice of the U.S. President. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you — including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation."" It appeared to be a threat of collective punishment against Gaza's civilian population for the actions of Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. Collective punishment is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, though neither the U.S. nor Israel are signatories to that treaty. Israel's renewed bombing of Gaza has drawn fierce condemnation from most of the country's Arab neighbors, and renewed efforts by Houthi militants in Yemen to target Israel and ships in the Red Sea with missiles. The Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a ""hypersonic ballistic missile"" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel. ""A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF (Israeli Air Force) prior to crossing into Israeli territory,"" the IDF said in a statement minutes after an all-clear was given. No damage was reported. The Houthis also claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group and its warships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, but the U.S. military said there were no impacts. The U.S. has responded to the Houthis' resumption of rocket launches with strikes against the group. Overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV. At least nine women and children were wounded in a residential neighborhood, a spokesperson for the Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry claimed in a post on X. U.S. strikes also hit targets in southern Yemen, in a province known to have Houthi military sites and weapons warehouses. President Trump had threatened on his Truth Social media platform that the group would ""be completely annihilated."" Thursday morning, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X that American ""forces continue 24/7 operations against the Iran-backed Houthis,""sharing undated videosof U.S. fighter jets taking off from an aircraft carrier. At least 31 people have been killed in Yemen by the U.S. airstrikes, according to Yemeni media reports. In a statement on Tuesday, CENTCOM said the Houthis had seized control of a World Food Program warehouse in the northern Yemeni city of Saada containing over 5,700,000 pounds of food and other humanitarian aid intended for civilians. ""This is another example of the Houthi's complete and reckless disregard for the people of Yemen and aggression toward the humanitarian operations that help those in need,"" CENTCOM said. ""The Houthis continue to violate international humanitarian law, as well as put aid workers and the Yemini people at risk. The Houthis care nothing for the Yemeni people.""

www.cbsnews.com,Retired Israeli general says Gaza strikes will mean more dead hostages,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-strikes-kill-hundreds-gaza-assault-hostages-dead/,"Updated on:  March 19, 2025 / 9:00 PM EDT/ CBS News Tel Aviv —For a second night in a row,Israel's military launchedairstrikesacross the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent. Separately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah. ""Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,"" the agency said. The statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck ""a U.N. compound"" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for ""media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports."" The mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-monthceasefirewith Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive. On Wednesday, Israel said it launched a ""limited ground operation"" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported. Even before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire. Dr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries. ""The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,"" he told CBS News in a phone interview. ""Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers."" Perlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies – he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands – made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries. Speaking of one boy, he said ""it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body – and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited – and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed."" Black plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations. ""Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,"" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. ""We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting."" Hamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023. Demonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv. ""I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people… to the people who elected them,"" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was ""horrified"" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen. ""I think it is much less likely,"" she said, shaking her head. ""We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward."" National polls consistently show a majority of Israelis – 70% ina February survey-- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza. Israel, with support from the Trump administration,demanded a change to those termsas Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House. Retired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides. But the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas. ""You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,"" he said. ""But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily."" Ziv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating ""without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table."" Ziv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them. Israel Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home. ""We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,"" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. ""History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages."" Ziv disagrees with that assessment. ""We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,"" he said. ""And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages."" ""To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.""

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 5:11 PM EDT/ CBS News Over the past few years,high inflationand the elevated cost of living that comes with it have made it increasingly difficult for many Americans to stay on top of their finances. With everyday essentials like groceries and gas becoming more expensive, some consumers have had to rely on credit cards just to cover basic expenses. As a result, total U.S. credit card debt soared toa record $1.21 trillion by the end of 2024. The financial strain caused by those issues is now evident.Credit card delinquencieshave been rising, signaling that more households are struggling to make even theminimum paymentson their accounts. Once missed payments start adding up, this type of high-rate debt can quickly spiral out of control, making it nearly impossible to pay off balances in a reasonable time frame. For example, at today's rates, it could take years to pay off a $10,000 balance, even with regular monthly payments. For those overwhelmed by debt,credit card debt forgivenesscould offer a path to relief. But how much could it actually save someone with a $10,000 balance this March? Let's break it down. Start on a path to credit card debt forgiveness today. Credit card debt forgivenessrefers to the process of settling a debt with your creditors for less than what's owed by negotiating with them directly or using a debt relief company to negotiate with your creditors. If you work with a debt relief company, the experts at the company will work with you to create a repayment plan based on your income and expenses. Once the payment plan is created, you'll make monthly payments to your debt relief service and will stop making payments to your credit card issuers. The money from your monthly payments is then held in a special savings account until you have enough funds to settle what you owe. After enough has been saved in the account, the debt relief company will begin negotiations with your credit card issuers, offering settlement amounts that are less than what you owe currently. If these negotiations are successful, a lump-sum payment is made and the remaining balance is forgiven. Generally speaking, debt forgivenessreduces your balance by 30% to 50%on average. As such, the process can be a financial lifesaver for some borrowers. For example, here's what your debt forgiveness would look like on a $10,000 balance if a settlement reduced your balance by 30%, 40% or 50%: And, to compare, here's what it would cost you to pay off a credit card with a $10,000 balance on a credit card with a 20.09% APR if you were making a monthly payment of $200 instead: As illustrated above, it would take you more than nine years and cost you more than $11,800 in interest to pay down a $10,000 credit card balance if you were making minimum monthly payments of $200. While the savings that credit card debt forgiveness offers can be substantial, there are some trade-offs. For starters, because you stop making payments on the debt you're trying to settle, yourcredit scoremay drop initially depending on where you started. Debt relief companies also typically charge between15% to 25%of the settled amount for their services, and you could owe taxes on the forgiven portion of your debt, as the IRS considers it to be income. Get started and tackle your high-rate credit card debt now. Generally speaking, toqualify for debt forgiveness, you typically need to have at least$5,000 to $10,000 in unsecured debtand prove that you're facing afinancial hardshipthatmakes it hard for you to pay down your debt. Hardships that might help you qualify for debt forgiveness include a job loss, a significant drop in income or medical bills. Debt can feel overwhelming, but solutions like credit card debt forgiveness can provide much-needed relief for those struggling to keep up with payments. By negotiating a settlement, borrowers may be able to significantly reduce what they owe, avoiding years of costly interest and accelerating their path to financial stability. While there are some trade-offs, such as potential credit score impacts and service fees, the long-term benefits of reducing debt burdens can far outweigh these temporary setbacks. J.R.

March 21, 2025 / 3:37 PM EDT/ CBS News Borrowing money comes with major concerns in today's economic environment, thanks to a frozenfederal funds ratethat has kept costs high on everything frommortgagestopersonal loansand more. One borrowing option that has remained relatively affordable, however, is reserved for homeowners viahome equity loansandhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs). And in the current climate in which home prices are high, there's anaverage of $313,000 worth of equityto utilize. That said, you won't necessarily be able to borrow all of that money. Mosthome equity lenders limit borrowers to 80% of their equitywhen applying for a home equity loan or HELOC. In the average scenario, that equates to just over $250,000. Still, your home is generally your most important financial asset, so borrowing from it should always be approached judiciously, and even more so if you're contemplating borrowing a quarter of a million dollars. To better prepare for this decision, then, it helps to calculate the potential monthly repayment costs tied to the home equity loan rates readily available for qualified borrowers in early 2025. Below, we'll do the math. Start by seeing how low of a home equity loan rate you could qualify for here. To determine the monthly costs of a home equity loan, potential borrowers will need three figures: the amount being withdrawn (in this case, $250,000), theinterest rateavailable (assuming the lowest rates for qualified borrowers), and therepayment period(typically 10- or 15-years). Here, then, is what a $250,000 home equity loan would cost monthly if secured now, in March 2025: While those rates are the averages for those specific repayment periods, the overall home equity loan median rate is a bit lower at 8.37% now. Here's what payments spread over that same period would then look like: It's also important to remember that, unlike HELOCs that have a draw period before repayments are required, home equity loans function differently. Since the funds will be provided up-front via one lump sum, borrowers will be expected to make the above payments right away. So it's important to determine affordability before applying, as you'll be expected to start paying back your lender immediately. And, if you fail to do so, you could risklosing your home to the lender in the process. Review your current home equity loan options carefully here. Whether you're borrowing$25,000 worth of home equity via a loanor ten times that amount, it's always important to first calculate your potential repayment costs. This is especially important to do now, with interest rates unpredictable and the impacts of years-longinflationstill making it difficult to cover many daily expenses. By doing the math, and understanding what you can and can't afford, you'll determine if a home equity loan is truly beneficial for you now or if you should instead consider alternative borrowing sources.

www.cbsnews.com,What is tax debt? A comprehensive explanation,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-tax-debt-a-comprehensive-explanation/,"We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. March 21, 2025 / 12:34 PM EDT/ CBS News Taxes are an unavoidable part of life. Whether you're a full-time employee, a freelancer or a business owner, you are legally obligated tofile and pay taxes on your incomeeach year. For many, this process ends with a refund check or perhaps a manageable payment. But for others, tax season results in a more troubling reality: owing the government more than they can afford to pay,leading to issues with tax debt. Tax debt may sound straightforward, but it's actually a complex financial situation that affects millions of people each year. According toInternal Revenue Service (IRS) data, the federal agency collects billions in back taxes, penalties and interest annually — and behind this staggering figure are people facing financial strain, confusion about their tax obligations and, in some cases, just simple, honest mistakes in filing. Regardless of the cause, though, tax debt is not something to take lightly. The IRS haspowerful collection toolsat its disposal, and ignoring tax debt can lead to serious consequences. So, understanding what exactly tax debt is, how it works and how to resolve it is crucial for anyone facing this type of financial challenge. Get help with your IRS tax debt today. Tax debt is any amount owed to federal, state or local tax authorities that remains unpaid after the filing deadline. At the federal level, this debt is owed to the IRS. Unlike most consumer debts, you don't choose to take on tax debt. Tax debt most commonly arises when you file a tax return showing thatyou owe more than you've already paidthrough withholding or estimated tax payments. However, tax debt can also result from: Explore your tax debt relief options and speak to an expert now. Unlike other creditors who must sue you and obtain a judgment before taking more severe collection actions, the IRS has administrative powers to collect tax debt without court approval. These powers include: The IRSapplies penalties to unpaid tax balances, causing the debt to grow over time. Common penalties include: Interest also compounds daily on both the unpaid tax and penalties. That rate is determined quarterly and is typically the federal short-term rate plus 3%. The good news is thattax debt doesn't last forever. The IRS generally has 10 years from the date of assessment to collect unpaid taxes. However, certain actions can extend this timeline, including: It's also worth noting that while the debt may become legally uncollectible after 10 years, the effects of that debt — such as damaged credit — can persist longer. The IRS offers several programs designed to help taxpayers resolve their tax debt, including: Tax debt represents a serious financial obligation that deserves immediate attention. Unlike other forms of debt, tax debt carries unique enforcement mechanisms and can quickly grow through penalties and interest. However, taxpayers have legitimate options for addressing tax debt, from payment plans to settlement programs. The worst approach to tax debt, though, is ignoring it. Being proactive — whether by contacting the IRS directly orseeking professional tax relief help— is the first step toward resolving tax debt and regaining financial stability.

www.cbsnews.com,"Spooked by U.S. immigration, Europeans rethink U.S. travel plans",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-immigration-detaining-european-tourists-borders/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 11:25 AM EDT/ CBS/AP Some Europeans are becoming leery of visiting the U.S., as reports of U.S. immigration authorities detaining them while traveling, for reasons that are not clear, swirl. A number of tourists from Europe say they have been stopped at U.S. border crossings and held at U.S. immigration detention facilities for weeks, despite holding tourist permits, work visas, or otherwise believing that they are authorized to travel to the U.S. A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada. And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fiancé, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime. Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody. ""What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,"" his fiancé, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that ""the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense."" ""The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,"" Rios told the Associated Press. U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed ""inadmissible"" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that ""if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal."" Universities have warned international faculty and students to consider refraining from traveling abroad, pointing to the Trump Administration's evolving federal travel policies. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage international students, staff, faculty and scholars — including U.S. visa holders and permanent residents (or 'green card holders') — to consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the U.S. Department of State,"" Brown University executive vice president for planning and policy Russell Carey, wrote in an email to the Brown community. A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade warcould also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S.just by alienating key allies and trade partners. Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025. International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics. ""The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,"" Tourism Economics said in the report. ""Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

www.cbsnews.com,DoorDash and Klarna to offer an eat-now and pay later plan,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/klarna-doordash-payments/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 1:39 PM EDT/ CBS News DoorDash and fintech company Klarna are joining forces to offer customers of the food delivery app the option of buying now and paying later. DoorDash customers will have the option either to pay in full, to pay in four equal installments or to postpone payment to ""a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck,"" DoorDash said Thursday in a news release. Deferring payments as a service for food purchases is increasingly widespread, and already offered by DoorDash rival Grubhub, as well as Walmart shoppers and those who bank at J.P. Morgan Chase. The buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, to be launched in the coming months according to the announcement, comes amid an economic climate that has moreAmericans reluctant to applyfor credit card, mortgage and car loans, data published on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve shows. Discouraged borrowers — those who reported needing credit but not applying for fear of being denied — reached 8.5% in February, the highest since the Fed began its tracking in 2013. Welcomed by shoppers as an interest-free way to make purchases, from clothing to travel, BNPL loans letborrowers pay over time. Usage of BNPL servicessurged during the pandemic, helping drive an online shopping boom. The pact with DoorDash marks a ""milestone in Klarna's expansion into everyday spending categories,"" David Sykes, the company's chief commercial officer,stated. Yet some BNPL providers drew complaints of giving customers the runaround in cases of disputed charges or returned items, prompting regulatory action by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in May of 2024. Consumer Reports is among the advocateswarning shoppersto be on guard against buy now, pay later loans, saying some come with high interest rates and fees. Klarna defended its business model in a blogpost, saying because it does not charge interest, it relies on customers paying on time, as opposed to credit cards. Those who miss payments are cut off from deferring more, a practice that leaves 99% of its lending repaid, it said. Its average user owes the company $100. The deal with DoorDash comes as the Swedish company readies an IPO. Founded in 2005, the food delivery and takeout platform partners with 675,000 merchants in 26 countries.

www.cbsnews.com,"Tesla trade-ins spike amid anti-Elon Musk backlash, Edmunds data shows",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-trade-ins-record-high-musk-backlash/,"March 21, 2025 / 6:16 PM EDT/ CBS News Motorists appear to be eager topart ways with their Tesla vehicles, with Tesla trade-ins reaching a record high this month, according to data from Edmunds. The rise in exchanges comes amidattacks on Tesla cars and dealershipstaking place across the country as people protest Elon Musk's role within the Trump administration. In March, the highest share ever of Teslas from model year 2017 or newer were traded in toward new or used purchases at dealerships, according to Edmunds, a U.S. car shopping website. Notably, the trade-ins were not used toward purchases of new Teslas. The Tesla EVs accounted for 1.4% of all vehicles traded in until March 15, marking a 0.4% rise from a year ago. Edmunds' data also indicates a dip in customers eyeing Teslas, based on browsing data on its website. In February, buyer interest in new Teslas dropped to 1.8%, its lowest point since October 2022. The number of car shoppers interested in purchasing the cars had peaked in November 2024, at 3.3%. ""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" Edmunds' head of insights Jessica Caldwell said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. She noted that diminished consumer sentiment around Tesla could present an opportunity for its competitors to gain market share. ""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest wavers, those offering competitive pricing, new technology or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers,"" Caldwell said. Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, has also warned that Musk's political actions are an ""overhang"" on the company's stock, and that the company is in the midst of a ""dark brand crisis tornado"" that only Musk himself can fix. Ives said that investors are not asking Musk to divorce himself from the Trump administration, or from the Department of Government Efficiency, which he's leading, but ""for balance as Tesla CEO and DOGE in this key period for Tesla.""

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth. That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets peoplepeople with disabilitiessave money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income andMedicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month. ""With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,"" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. ""It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him."" Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify. ""The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits — that was really restricting a lot of families,"" Elliot said. ""People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000."" Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well. Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account — including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers — up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account. There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for ""qualified disability expenses,"" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further. Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer. ""Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'"" he said. ""We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed."" According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection. Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of peoplesurveyed for a 2023 report by the organizationdid not know these accounts existed. ""Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,"" Warren said. ""Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts)."" Here's what to know.

The field of 68 teams includes the usual powerhouses like defending champion South Carolina and UConn – but the growth in the women's tournament opens up the possibility that it's anyone's game. Hidalgo hopes it's No. 3 seed Notre Dame's turn. At5 feet 6 inches, the sophomore proves that heart can triumph over height. But Hidalgo acknowledges she wants to stand out from the other taller guards. ""On the floor, I'm very energetic. I'm yelling. I'm diving on the floor. Sometimes I'm flashy; sometimes I'm fundamental,"" Hidalgo told ""CBS Mornings"" as she prepared for Friday's game against No. 14 Stephen F. Austin in South Bend, Indiana. Hidalgo gives it her all in every game, and credits her teammates for giving her ""the keys"" and putting trust in her both on and off the court. ""You have to have effort. You have to have that want, that dog in you. That dog in you is important,"" she said. ""I want to take my opponent's heart anytime I step out on the court. Anytime I'm guarding them."" As an undersized guard, Hidalgo says it's critical to be able to play both sides of the floor, focusing on both her offensive and defensive game. At Notre Dame, where the greats have played like champions, Hidalgo has played beyond her years. As a freshman, she led the nation in steals. She became the fourth player in history to be named a first-team All-American as a freshman and sophomore,Notre Dame says. Hidalgo got an early career start by practicing with her big brothers on outside courts while growing up in Merchantville, New Jersey, where she earned the nickname ""Buckets."" She learned the game from her parents – with her dad coaching her in high school. She joked that he had no problem telling her the truth.

The move comes after Mr. Trump had alreadyannounced last monththat he was revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance. In a memo Friday, the president said he was also rescinding the security clearances of the entire Biden family. Also losing their access to classified information and their security clearances were former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, New York Attorney General Letita James, Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, former White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Rep. Elizabeth Cheney, former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen, and attorney Mark Zaid,who was a lawyerfor the whistleblower who reported concerns about the Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine in his first White House term. Several of those named, including James and Bragg,had already had their clearances revokedearlier this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a purge of dozens of clearances for current and former officials. Friday's memo applies to ""receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress."" Since taking office in January, the president has revoked the clearances of multiple former officials who he claims ""weaponized"" either the intelligence community or the law against him. Cheney and Kinzinger helped leadthe House select committee investigationinto the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Bragg brought the New York ""hush money"" criminal case which resulted in a felony conviction for Mr. Trump on34 state countsof falsification of business records. James sued Mr. Trump and the Trump organization, accusing them of widespread fraud. The lengthy trialresulted in a judge's $453 million verdictagainst Mr. Trump and his former company. Those who had previously had their clearances revoked includeretired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Trump and Biden administrations and had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over thephoto opin front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House. Mr. Trump was also critical of Milley's revelation that he had engaged in two phone calls — one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second onJan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection — with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable. On the day of his inauguration, Mr. Trumprevokedthe clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming that emails found on a laptop owned by Biden's son, Hunter, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Mr. Trump's first term, also had his clearance pulled over a book he penned about his time in the role. The president accused Bolton of publishing sensitive information and said the book's publication ""created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.""

""Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones,"" Foreman's family announced on Instagram. ""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,"" his family continued in the post. No cause of death was given. ""George was a great friend to not only myself but to my entire family. We've lost a family member and are absolutely devastated,"" Top Rank president Bob Arum said in astatement. Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas, but grew up in Houston's Fifth Ward, and was raised alongside his six siblings by a single mother. Foreman was open about his troublesome childhood. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and became a""mugger and brawler."" An Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion, Foreman competed between 1967 and 1997. He learned to box at age 16, won Olympic gold at 19. He stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!"" In 1974, he tried to defend his title in Zaire in one of the most famous fights in history. The ""Rumble in the Jungle,"" against Muhammad Ali. Foreman described the fight toCBS Morningsin 2016 as a ""strange"" experience. ""I thought I'd knock him out in one or two rounds, but about the third round, I'd hit him, and he fell on me. I thought, 'That's it.' And he started screaming, 'That all you got, George?! Show me something!' And I knew then I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he said at the time. Foreman said he and Ali, who died in 2016, became lifelong friends after the fight. Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade as a preacher after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a title fight in 1991. In 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer and became the oldest world champion in boxing history at 45 years old. Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023. Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman. ""Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. ""His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles. Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change. ""It's tough to say,"" Wishengrad said. ""At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does."" The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare. ""A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,"" Caldwell explained. ""…If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American."" Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issueda one-month reprieveto U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he alsoissued a pauseuntil Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Caldwell says that she suspects that in ""many cases"" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them. ""Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,"" Caldwell added. She notes that while automakers ""can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time."" In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.""It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,"" Caldwell said. When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear.""So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,"" Caldwell said. ""We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution."" Wishengrad agrees that the back-and-forth about the trade war has become white noise for consumers. ""I do think so, eventually, you know, people start to tune that out.""

""The U.S. saw China gunning down its own citizens and then also successfully covering it up afterwards,"" RFA President Bay Fang told CBS News. ""The U.S. Congress created us with an eye to giving these people in China and other authoritarian countries around Asia the ability to have free press, to get access to the truth through an unbiased news service."" Fang put 75% of RFA staff on leave Friday, the result of funding cuts ordered byKari Lake, senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of RFA andVoice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster. Last weekend, all full-time employees and contractors with VOAwere informedthey were being placed on administrative leave, while Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were notified that federal grants for both broadcasters had been terminated. ""USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law,"" the agency said in a March 15 statement. Lake, a former television broadcaster who ran unsuccessful Republican governor and Senate campaigns in Arizona,had beeninitially tapped by President Trump to serve as VOA director before taking on the role of senior adviser to USAGM. RFA had a full-time staff of about 400 people prior to the layoffs, according toits website. It also had another approximately 500 stringers and contractors. At least eight RFA journalists could be forced to leave the U.S. if they lose their work visas. Vietnamese journalist Khoa Lai is one of them and fears the possibility of being deported. ""I believe so, but I hope not,"" Lai said. ""I believe that if I go back, then the government will snatch me right away."" Five people who worked for RFA are already behind bars overseas. RFA funds their families and their legal defense. ""These are not U.S. citizens, but they are people who are in jail because they worked for a U.S.- funded network,"" Fang said. RFA's stated mission is to provide fair, objective and uncensored news and information to Asian nations where there are few, if any, free speech protections. ""We're worth saving because we actually bring benefit to the U.S. taxpayer,"" Fang said. ""I think it is in the U.S. national security interest to have something like us. We are actually one of the lowest cost-effective elements of soft power that they could have."" RFA told CBS News that unless the courts, Congress or a private financier steps in, it only has enough money to continue broadcasting for approximately one more month. On Friday, meanwhile, a group of VOA employees filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking to be reinstated.

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth. That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets peoplepeople with disabilitiessave money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income andMedicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month. ""With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,"" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. ""It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him."" Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify. ""The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits — that was really restricting a lot of families,"" Elliot said. ""People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000."" Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well. Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account — including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers — up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account. There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for ""qualified disability expenses,"" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further. Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer. ""Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'"" he said. ""We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.'

www.cbsnews.com,Boeing whistleblower's family accuses company of hounding him before suicide,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-lawsuit-family-barnett-whistleblower-safety-issues/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 7:53 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The family of a formerBoeing quality control managerwho police say killed himself after lawyers questioned him for days about his whistleblowing on alleged jumbo jet defects are suing the aviation giant. Boeing subjected John Barnett to a ""campaign of harassment, abuse and intimidation intended to discourage, discredit and humiliate him until he would either give up or be discredited,"" lawyers for the family wrote in a wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in South Carolina. Barnett, 62,shot himselfMarch 9, 2024, in Charleston after answering questions from attorneys for several days in relation to adefamation lawsuithe had filed against Boeing. He lived in Louisiana. ""Boeing had threatened to break John, and break him it did,"" the attorneys wrote in court papers on behalf of his family. Boeing has not yet responded in court filings. ""We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,"" the company said in a statement this week. Barnett was aBoeing employee for 32 years, working as a quality-control manager before he retired in 2017. In the years after that, he shared his concerns with journalists and became a whistleblower. ""John became concerned when he transferred to Boeing's South Carolina plant in 2010 — quality issues, procedures that wasn't being followed, short cuts that was trying to be taken,"" his brother Rodney Barnett,told CBS Morning Newsin an exclusive interview in March 2024. Barnett said he once saw discarded metal shavings near wiring for the flight controls that could have cut the wires and caused a catastrophe. He also noted problems with up to a quarter of the oxygen systems on Boeing's 787 planes. Barnett shared his concerns with his supervisors and others before leaving Boeing, but according to the lawsuit they responded by ignoring him and then harassing him. Boeing intentionally gave Barnett inaccurate, poor job reviews and less desirable shifts, according to the lawsuit. Barnett's family argues the company publicly blamed him for delays that angered his co-workers and prevented him from transferring to another plant. Barnett eventually was diagnosed with PTSD and his mental condition deteriorated, his family said. ""Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to his death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that PTSD and John's unbearable depression, panic attacks, and anxiety, which would in turn lead to an elevated risk of suicide,"" the lawsuit said. ""Boeing may not have pulled the trigger, but Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death."" A panel of experts in February 2024 criticized Boeing's safety culture, raising the heat on the aircraft manufacturer following a Jan. 5 incident in which the door panel of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 plane made by theBoeing blew off mid-flight. The incident came after other safety issueshad been linkedto Boeing's Max line of aircraft, heightening concerns about the jet's safety. In itsreportfollowing the Alaska Airlines blowout, the Federal Aviation Administration said a panel of government and aviation industry experts had ""found a lack of awareness of safety-related metrics at all levels"" of Boeing, adding that ""employees had difficulty distinguishing the differences among various measuring methods, their purpose and outcomes."" ""The failure of quality control at Boeing over the last decade is well known and well documented, as are the consequences of that failure, which include planes crashing and coming apart in the air,"" lawyers state in the lawsuit filed on behalf of Barnett's mother Vicky Stokes and two other family members. The lawsuit doesn't specify the amount of damages sought by Barnett's family but asks for compensation for emotional distress and mental anguish, back pay, 10 years of lost future earnings as well as bonuses, health expenses and his lost life insurance benefits. ___ If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineby calling or texting 988.

The move comes after Mr. Trump had alreadyannounced last monththat he was revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance. In a memo Friday, the president said he was also rescinding the security clearances of the entire Biden family. Also losing their access to classified information and their security clearances were former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, New York Attorney General Letita James, Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, former White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Rep. Elizabeth Cheney, former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen, and attorney Mark Zaid,who was a lawyerfor the whistleblower who reported concerns about the Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine in his first White House term. Several of those named, including James and Bragg,had already had their clearances revokedearlier this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a purge of dozens of clearances for current and former officials. Friday's memo applies to ""receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress."" Since taking office in January, the president has revoked the clearances of multiple former officials who he claims ""weaponized"" either the intelligence community or the law against him. Cheney and Kinzinger helped leadthe House select committee investigationinto the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Bragg brought the New York ""hush money"" criminal case which resulted in a felony conviction for Mr. Trump on34 state countsof falsification of business records. James sued Mr. Trump and the Trump organization, accusing them of widespread fraud. The lengthy trialresulted in a judge's $453 million verdictagainst Mr. Trump and his former company. Those who had previously had their clearances revoked includeretired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Trump and Biden administrations and had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over thephoto opin front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House. Mr. Trump was also critical of Milley's revelation that he had engaged in two phone calls — one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second onJan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection — with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable. On the day of his inauguration, Mr. Trumprevokedthe clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming that emails found on a laptop owned by Biden's son, Hunter, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Mr. Trump's first term, also had his clearance pulled over a book he penned about his time in the role. The president accused Bolton of publishing sensitive information and said the book's publication ""created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.""

""The U.S. saw China gunning down its own citizens and then also successfully covering it up afterwards,"" RFA President Bay Fang told CBS News. ""The U.S. Congress created us with an eye to giving these people in China and other authoritarian countries around Asia the ability to have free press, to get access to the truth through an unbiased news service."" Fang put 75% of RFA staff on leave Friday, the result of funding cuts ordered byKari Lake, senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of RFA andVoice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster. Last weekend, all full-time employees and contractors with VOAwere informedthey were being placed on administrative leave, while Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were notified that federal grants for both broadcasters had been terminated. ""USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law,"" the agency said in a March 15 statement. Lake, a former television broadcaster who ran unsuccessful Republican governor and Senate campaigns in Arizona,had beeninitially tapped by President Trump to serve as VOA director before taking on the role of senior adviser to USAGM. RFA had a full-time staff of about 400 people prior to the layoffs, according toits website. It also had another approximately 500 stringers and contractors. At least eight RFA journalists could be forced to leave the U.S. if they lose their work visas. Vietnamese journalist Khoa Lai is one of them and fears the possibility of being deported. ""I believe so, but I hope not,"" Lai said. ""I believe that if I go back, then the government will snatch me right away."" Five people who worked for RFA are already behind bars overseas. RFA funds their families and their legal defense. ""These are not U.S. citizens, but they are people who are in jail because they worked for a U.S.- funded network,"" Fang said. RFA's stated mission is to provide fair, objective and uncensored news and information to Asian nations where there are few, if any, free speech protections. ""We're worth saving because we actually bring benefit to the U.S. taxpayer,"" Fang said. ""I think it is in the U.S. national security interest to have something like us. We are actually one of the lowest cost-effective elements of soft power that they could have."" RFA told CBS News that unless the courts, Congress or a private financier steps in, it only has enough money to continue broadcasting for approximately one more month. On Friday, meanwhile, a group of VOA employees filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking to be reinstated.

www.cbsnews.com,U.S. to revoke legal status of more than a half-million migrants,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-to-revoke-legal-status-of-over-a-half-million-migrants-chnv/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:11 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration will be revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Latin American and Haitian migrants welcomed into the U.S. under a Biden-era sponsorship process, urging them to self-deport or face arrest and removal by deportation agents. The termination of their work permits and deportation protections under an immigration authority known as parole will take effect in late April, 30 days after March 25,according to a noticeposted by the federal government. The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program,known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues. A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally. CBS Newsfirst reportedin early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process. The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation. But DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card. In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV process were ""loosely vetted,"" and argued the program undercut American workers. ""The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,"" McLaughlin added.

www.cbsnews.com,Here's the West Wing seating chart — whose offices are closest to Trump?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-white-house-seating-chart/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 6:26 PM EDT/ CBS News The senior adviser with the West Wing office closest to the action — the Oval Office — in President Trump's second term is Dan Scavino, one of his longest-serving inner circle aides. Influence with the president of the United States has often been a factor in the physical proximity of an adviser's office to the Oval, but it may matter less in Mr. Trump's second term, when he keeps tabs by phone with the power players whose insights he values most. But the seating chart in the West Wing, which still has some empty desks, still remains a source of intrigue for players inside and outside the White House, people familiar with the layout told CBS News. Scavino occupies the office next to the president's private dining room, the spot Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner used during the first term and Mike Donilon had during Joe Biden's presidency. Scavino, the voice of Trump's MAGA movement whose social media followers who hang on every short video and comment he posts, is now deputy chief of staff. Next to Scavino, in the officeSteve Bannonused during his seven months as chief strategist the first Trump administration, is James Blair, a deputy chief of staff who served as political director for Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign. Susie Wileshas the roomy corner spot that anchors the suite that has traditionally been the chief of staff's. Also in the power hallway is Beau Harrison, deputy chief of staff for operations. He's in the cubicle-like office Biden adviser Bruce Reed sat in. Technically, the desk with the least real estate between it and the Trump's Oval belongs to Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications adviser. She's in the outer Oval with Chamberlain Harris, a receptionist; Natalie Harp, a former One America News Network anchor who played a body-man role during the campaign; and Walt Nauta, a military aide and presidential valet who was accused of obstructing the government's efforts in an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago. The charges were dismissed by federal courts weeks into Mr. Trump's second term. Along the western hallway in the West Wing, in the usual placement for their respective offices, are Vice President JD Vance and national security adviserMike Waltz. Vance's chief of staff Jacob Reses is in the VP's suite. Alex Wong, deputy national security adviser; and senior adviser Micah Ketchel are in Waltz's suite. Brian McCormack, the National Security Council chief of staff, and spokesperson Brian Hughes are on the ground floor, not far from the Situation Room, while most of the rest of the NSC staff are in the building next door, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Border czar Tom Homan is down near the Navy Mess. Also on the basement level are special envoySteve Witkoff, the faith office's Paula White-Cain and the staff secretary, Will Scharf. One of Mr. Trump's top advisers, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, is in a suite upstairs along with policy strategist May Davis Mailman. David Warrington and the White House counsel offices are on the second level, as is Alina Habba, counselor to the president. Down the hall on the second floor are Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council; deputy chief of staff Nick Luna; Vince Haley, who heads the domestic policy council; and head speechwriter Ross Worthington. Other key players on the main floor near the Oval are Taylor Budowich, deputy chief of staff for communications and cabinet affairs, in the most spacious press office; communications director Steven Cheung; press secretaryKaroline Leavittand, in the area known as lower press, Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary. Some of the heaviest hitters in the president's orbit don't have West Wing offices, including cabinet secretaries such as Commerce's Howard Lutnick and government efficiency aideElon Musk, who has an office in the EEOB. And some of his advisers aren't in government, including members of his family, his personal senior counselBoris Epshteynand former communications aide Jason Miller.

www.cbsnews.com,ABLE accounts allow Americans with disabilities to save and invest,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/able-accounts-americans-disabilities-world-down-syndrome-day/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 6:56 PM EDT/ AP Paul Safarik, 32, of Lincoln, Nebraska, has worked in the food industry since he was 21, delivering for quick service restaurants like Raising Cane's and stocking groceries at stores like Trader Joe's. With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth. That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets peoplepeople with disabilitiessave money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income andMedicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month. ""With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,"" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. ""It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him."" Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify. ""The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits — that was really restricting a lot of families,"" Elliot said. ""People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000."" Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well. Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account — including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers — up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account. There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for ""qualified disability expenses,"" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further. Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer. ""Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'"" he said. ""We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed."" According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection. Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of peoplesurveyed for a 2023 report by the organizationdid not know these accounts existed. ""Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,"" Warren said. ""Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts)."" Here's what to know. Two online resources —ABLE Todayand theABLE National Resource Center— can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies. Right now, ABLE accounts are for: A qualifying person must also meet one of the following criteria: In 2026, the age limit for ABLE accounts will rise to 46. You can begin educating yourself now about the process of setting up the account, so you can add money and fund the account right away beginning in January 2026. Family, friends, and organizations may also begin setting money aside with the intention of contributing it to the account in the individual's name as of January 1. © 2025 The Associated Press.

www.cbsnews.com,Health agencies brace for layoffs with RFK Jr.'s restructuring of HHS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-nih-hhs-layoffs-doge-rfk-jr-restructuring/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:22 PM EDT/ CBS News Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department. Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement. The department did not respond to a request for comment. In addition to the formal head of the White House'sDepartment of Government Efficiencyteam,Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE areHHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executiveBrad Smith, who was a topMedicareandMedicaidofficial during the first Trump administration. The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and ""reduction-in-force"" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, likeearlier attemptsto purge thousands ofprobationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements. Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut. The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, includingdecades-old datasetstracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on. AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like aprogramaimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria. ""The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,"" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database onmedical spending. At theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go. Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federalrecordsshow, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration. ""A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,"" one CDC official said. Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, underoffers madeacross HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both. Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department. Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at theFood and Drug Administrationwere told they were ineligible to take up the HHSbuyout offer. That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers. Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts. DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week. Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said. Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms. From the workforce at theNational Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration. More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year. Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both. One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures. Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration. The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicyreportedin November. There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019. One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff. Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts. Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedydenouncing reportsthat half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs. The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration. The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted inmore than 10%of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.

www.cbsnews.com,Map shows which cities could be hit hard by spring allergies,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/allergy-season-cities-2025/,"March 21, 2025 / 2:24 PM EDT/ CBS News Springis here — and with it comes allergy season. Each year, more than 100 million people in the U.S. experience allergies, including seasonalpollen allergies. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has releasedits annual reportfor 2025, ranking the most challenging U.S. cities for those dealing withseasonal allergies. The report ranks the top 100 U.S. cities based on pollen levels, over-the-counterallergy medicationuse and access to allergists. For three years in a row, Wichita, Kansas, ranks as the most challenging city for pollen allergies. Cities in the South and East are among the hardest hit. New Orleans, which ranked 34th last year, jumped to second place this year due to a surge in weed pollen, likely from moisture fromHurricane Francine, which made landfall back in September.  Also, November 2024 was the warmest on record in Louisiana, and the warmer temperatures extended the growing season. Several cities that ranked ""better than average"" were mostly in the Northeast, where pollen typically peaks in the fall season. However, a2024 droughtmay have reduced weed pollen levels, according to the report. Boston was ranked as the least challenging city for allergies, likely due to its low pollen and high number of allergists. Even though the most challenging cities were concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the country, the West saw some changes. For example, wet weather in California ""increased grass and weed pollen counts in 2024 compared to 2023,"" according to the report. This caused several cities to jump in rankings. The increased pollen counts may be ""due to an abundance ofatmospheric riversin 2024 that particularly impacted Central and Southern California but brought much of the state to near or above normal precipitation levels,"" Hannah Jaffee, research director for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, said in an email. Withclimate patternsshifting, seasons arestarting earlier and lasting longerbecause ofclimate change. In some regions, tree, grass or weed pollen is present year-round. Additionally,warmer temperaturestrap heatin urban areas, increasing air pollution and increasing pollen production, according to the report. Rich Lucas, chief data officer atPollen Sense, analyzed pollen data correlated with large weather events and found cities showed pollen spikes around the weather. For example, in Boise, Idaho, tree pollen levels increased significantly in 2023 and 2024. This was likely due to above-average snowfall in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, providing moisture for tree growth and increasing pollen. Weeds in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, surged in the fall of 2024. Storms removed ground cover, allowing weeds to quickly recolonize and grow in the moist conditions. In Tampa, Florida, weed levels were sporadic in the fall of 2024, affected by threenamed storms. Both weeds and grass responded to the fluctuations and added moisture and recovery time between storms. The high tree pollen peak was not present in December 2024 because the cedar pollen season did not start until January 2025. Pollen production in Poughkeepsie, New York, decreased in 2024, likely due to drought conditions in the Northeast, which reduced tree pollen output. If the city you live in is ranked poorly, Jaffee offered some advice. ""Before you pack up your things and move, it's important to remember that there are many available and accessible options to help you find allergy relief no matter where you live,"" she said. Here are some steps you can take to lessen allergy symptoms: Jaffee mentioned that an allergy specialist can help with finding a treatment plan that works for your specific allergy situation.

www.cbsnews.com,Insomnia can lead to heart issues. A psychologist shares tips for better sleep.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/insomnia-heart-disease-psychologist-sleep-tips/,"March 20, 2025 / 5:00 PM EDT/ The Conversation About 10% of Americans say they havechronic insomnia, and millions of others report poorsleepquality.Ongoing researchhas found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems,including heart disease. Dr. Julio Fernandez-Mendozais a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, neuroscience and public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine. He discusses the need for sleep, why teenagers require more sleep than adults, and how you can get a good night's sleep without medications. The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion that have been edited for brevity and clarity. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza:Adults who report getting about seven to eight hours ofsleepper night generally havethe best health, in terms of both physical and mental health, and longevity. But that recommendationchanges with age. Adults over age 65 may need justsix to seven hours of sleepper night. So older people, if otherwise healthy, should not feel anxious if they're getting just six hours.Young peopleneed the most –at least nine hours– and some younger children may need more. Fernandez-Mendoza:Our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia – difficulty falling or staying asleep – were more likely to have high blood pressure and beat risk for heart disease. In both teens and adults, we found that insomnia and shortened sleep may lead to elevatedstress, hormone levels and inflammation. These problems tend to show upbefore you develop heart disease. Fernandez-Mendoza:Good sleep hygiene habitsinclude cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, quitting smoking and exercising regularly. I also recommend not skipping meals, not eating too late at night and not eating too much. But people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes. Research studies point to aset of six rulesthat can improve your sleep. You can follow these changes consistently in the short term, and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road. First, get up at the same time no matter what. No matter how much sleep you get. This will anchor your sleep/wake cycle, calledyour circadian rhythm. Second, do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity. Third, when you can't sleep, don't lie in bed awake. Instead, get out of bed, go into another room if you can, and do an activity that's enjoyable or relaxing. Go back to bed only when you're ready to sleep. Fourth, get going with daily activities even after a poor night's sleep. Don't try to compensate for sleep loss. If you have chronic insomnia, don't nap, sleep in, or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night. Fifth, go to bed only when you're actually sleepy enough to fall asleep. And sixth, start with the amount of sleep you're now getting – with the lowest limit at five hours – and then increase it weekly by 15 minutes. These six rules are evidence-based and go above and beyond simple sleep hygiene habits. If they don't work, see a provider who can help you. Fernandez-Mendoza:Adolescence is a unique developmental period. It's not just the obvious physical, emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty – there arechanges in a teenager's brainthat can alter their sleep patterns. When an adolescent goes through puberty, their internal clock changes so that their sleep scheduleshifts to later hours. While it's true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships, there's also biology behind why they want to stay up late – their internal clocks have shifted. It's not just choice. School start times for most adolescentsare at odds with that biological shift. So they don't get enough sleep, which affects their performance in school. Research suggests thatschools with later start timesare more closelyaligned with the science on child developmentand don't put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to. Parents can helptheir teens get better sleep. Set a time for kids to stop doing homework andput away electronics. Instead, they can watch TV with the family or read – something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed. You can also gradually move back their wake-up time. Start on weekends, waking them up 30 minutes earlier every day, including school days, until the child reaches the desired wake-up time. Don't try to reshift them suddenly – for example, waking up a teenager at 5 a.m. like it's the military – because that doesn't work. They won't get used to it, since it's at odds with their internal clock. So, do it little by little. If that doesn't work, see a clinical provider. Fernandez-Mendoza:People should get help if they feel they sleep poorly, if they're fatigued during the day, or if they snore or grind their teeth. All these issues deserve attention. Some people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication, but that's not true. There are behavioral, non-drug-based treatments that work. Cognitive behavioral therapy is thefirst-line treatment recommended for insomnia. Light therapy may also help, which is theuse of a bright light therapy lampat a given time during the day or evening, depending on the person's sleep problem. Watch thefull interviewto hear more.

www.cbsnews.com,"Slain DEA agent's family sues Sinaloa cartel, drug kingpins over 1985 murder",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-dea-agent-enrique-kiki-camarena-sues-sinaloa-cartel/,"March 21, 2025 / 3:28 PM EDT/ CBS News The family of slain DEA agentEnrique ""Kiki"" Camarenasued Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and three alleged drug kingpins in federal court in California over his 1985 murder. The lawsuit – filed Thursday under a newdesignationby President Trump that classifies several drug cartels as terrorist organizations – seeks to hold Rafael Caro-Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo, Miguel Angel Felix-Gallardo and the Sinaloa cartel responsible for Camarena's death and provide relief to his family. Drug kingpinCaro-Quintero, alleged by the U.S. to have ordered the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena, continued to direct drug trafficking operations while in prison in Mexico after his conviction there in the murder. Court documents said he continued to work with the Sinaloa cartel. Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo and Miguel Angel Felix-Gallardo are also named as defendants in court documents for their alleged role in planning and directing Camarena's kidnapping, torture and murder. Caro-Quinterowas sent to the United States last month for allegeddrug traffickingand acts of extreme violence,along with 28 other prisonersrequested by the U.S. government. ""Today sends a message to every cartel leader, every trafficker, every criminal poisoning our communities: You will be held accountable,"" DEA Acting Administrator Derek S. Maltz said in a statement at the time. ""No matter how long it takes, no matter how far you run, justice will find you."" Fonseca-Carrillo is under house arrest in Mexico for his role in the murder, according to court documents and Felix-Gallardo was arrested in 1989 by Mexican authorities. After being convicted of Camarena's kidnapping and murder, he was sentenced to 40 years in a Mexican prison. Camarena was living in Guadalajara, Mexico, with his family and working as an undercover DEA agent when he was kidnapped on the street in broad daylight 40 years ago. He was headed to a luncheon with his wife Mika, according to court documents. Court documents said Mika went to the local Chinese restaurant in Guadalajara, where she had planned to meet her husband. She waited for him and eventually ate and left, assuming that his work had delayed him. She took care of her young sons that afternoon not knowing her husband was being brutally tortured. Mika went to bed and awoke the next morning to learn that he had not come home, court documents said. An autopsy suggested Camarena's death was caused by a puncture through the skull and into the brain, likely from a steel rebar or tire iron. Mexican forensic examiners said Camarena died from ""trauma craniocerebral and asphyxiation due to suffocation."" Cara Tabachnick is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

www.cbsnews.com,U.S. mulls expanding military ties with Japan despite Trump's criticism,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-japan-military-defense-ties-trump-china-threat/,"March 21, 2025 / 12:34 PM EDT/ CBS News Tokyo —President Trump in early March criticized what he characterized as a one-sided security alliance between the U.S. and Japan. Officials in Japan have heard these comments from Mr. Trump before, and so far, they've continued shaping the country's national security plans based on the assurance of backing from the United States. Government officials admit they really have no other choice. ""There is no Plan B for Japan other than the U.S.,"" Takuya Akiyama,Principal Deputy Director of the North American Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News. ""Treaty wise and also as a physical presence, no other country can substitute the U.S. It is unthinkable."" The U.S.may be pulling back from Europeunder President Trump, but despite his remarks about Japan, U.S. military cooperation with Tokyo has appeared stable, and may even expand as the White House ramps up its standoff with Asia's increasinglyassertive superpower, China. Japanese officials may have breathed a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to the White House in February. The Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to Japan's defense, including amid Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over ownership of theSenkaku islands. It is one of many land ownership disputes between China and its neighbors over islands in theSouth China Sea— virtually all of which Beijing claims as its territory. The White House has repeatedly condemnedChinese aggressionand militarization in the South China Sea, and U.S. warships and aircraft routinely carry out ""freedom of navigation"" exercises in the area — often drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing. Advisers to the Japanese prime minister spent the months after the U.S. election preparing him for the meeting with Mr. Trump. They focused on using clear and concise language to convey the benefits of the security alliance to the U.S., and the increase Japan has made in its own defense spending and military procurement from America, according to officials at the Japanese foreign ministry. China has been rapidlybolstering its military capabilities, including its nuclear program, in recent years, according to U.S. officials. Last year, China announceda 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which was already the world's second-highest, behind only the United States. In February, Taiwan condemned China and deployed its own forces in response as the Chinese militaryheld ""shooting training"" drillsin the Taiwan Strait. ""From an American perspective, it's clear that if Taiwan falls, and if Japan falls, that our alliances in the Indo-Pacific are over,"" Kenneth Weinstein, Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute think tank, told CBS News. ""China will exercise extraordinary military sway — will be able to close down global shipping such as they see it, will be able to throttle access to the South China Sea and elsewhere."" There have already been tense encounters between Japanese and Chinese naval vessels around the Senkaku islands, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo. According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 — the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008. The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries. While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation. ""The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,"" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. ""We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region."" Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities. The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might. While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of theU.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand. The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese. In the event of a regional security crisis — such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island — having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region. The dramaticvacillations by the Trump administrationin its stance onUkrainehave also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor. ""In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,"" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. ""I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow."" The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. ""The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,"" professor Takahara told CBS News. ""That kind of message will be received in Beijing."" Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy. ""We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,"" Takahara said. ""But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.",2025-03-22 00:52:31
www.cbsnews.com,What are the world's busiest airports?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/busiest-airports-in-the-world/,"March 21, 2025 / 12:05 PM EDT/ CBS News London —The sudden, full-dayclosure of London's Heathrow Airporton Friday caused by a fire in a nearby electrical substation threw the travel plans of an estimated 200,000 people into disarray. Heathrow is one of the world's busiest, most internationally connected airports, and it warned in a statement Friday that it expected ""significant disruption over the coming days,"" telling passengers not to go to the airport ""under any circumstances"" until it reopens. According to the FlightRadar24 tracking website, an estimated 1,350 flights were directly impacted by the Heathrow closure on Friday. The effects of the shutdown are expected to linger for days as so much international travel relies on the facility as a hub for connections. Below is a look at the busiest airports in the world this month, according to statistics compiled by the global travel data platformOAG. The busiest airport in the world in March 2025, as measured by the number of seats available on both domestic and international flights, is Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, with a capacity of nearly 5.4 million seats. It is also easily the busiest airport in the United States. Atlanta is followed closely in the OAG rankings by Dubai International and then Haneda Airport outside Japan's capital of Tokyo. In March, Dallas Fort Worth International is ranked at No. 4, with just over 4.1 million airline seats available on its routes. Heathrow comes in at No. 5 on the list of the world's busiest airports this month. The OAG statistics show Heathrow and Dallas Fort Worth swapped positions in the ranking between March 2024 and this month. Overall during 2024, the top five looked the same inOAG's rankingsas this month, but Heathrow held onto the 4th-busiest slot for the year, edging out Dallas Fort Worth with a total of 51.55 million seats available compared to the Texas hub's 51.51 million. Below is the list of the airports that round out OAG's ranking of the top 10 busiest in the world in March 2025: 6. Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China 7. Denver International Airport in Colorado 8. Delhi Airport in India 9. Chicago O'Hare International in Illinois 10. Baiyun International in China While it is not the busiest by measure of the number of seats available on scheduled flights, London's Heathrow is the best-connected airport in the world, according to OAG, as measured by the total number of destinations served and the number of scheduled connections. If domestic flights are removed from the equation, Heathrow would move up the ranking to become the world's second busiest airport, behind only Dubai International. Heathrow is also the busiest of Europe's airports, by number of seats available. While it doesn't even make the list of the top 10busiestfacilities on the planet, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd International Airport holds a record of its own — officially. According toGuinness World Records, King Fahd, which is near the city of Dammam, about 200 miles east of the Saudi capital Riyadh, is the world's largest airport. It sprawls over a remarkable 300 square miles, according to the Guinness World Records website. Heathrow, by comparison, covers just under five square miles on its plot about 14 miles west of central London. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.",2025-03-22 00:52:34
www.cbsnews.com,"Spooked by U.S. immigration, Europeans rethink U.S. travel plans",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-immigration-detaining-european-tourists-borders/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 11:25 AM EDT/ CBS/AP Some Europeans are becoming leery of visiting the U.S., as reports of U.S. immigration authorities detaining them while traveling, for reasons that are not clear, swirl. A number of tourists from Europe say they have been stopped at U.S. border crossings and held at U.S. immigration detention facilities for weeks, despite holding tourist permits, work visas, or otherwise believing that they are authorized to travel to the U.S. A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada. And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fiancé, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime. Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody. ""What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,"" his fiancé, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that ""the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense."" ""The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,"" Rios told the Associated Press. U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed ""inadmissible"" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that ""if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal."" Universities have warned international faculty and students to consider refraining from traveling abroad, pointing to the Trump Administration's evolving federal travel policies. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage international students, staff, faculty and scholars — including U.S. visa holders and permanent residents (or 'green card holders') — to consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the U.S. Department of State,"" Brown University executive vice president for planning and policy Russell Carey, wrote in an email to the Brown community. A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade warcould also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S.just by alienating key allies and trade partners. Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025. International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics. ""The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,"" Tourism Economics said in the report. ""Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

www.cbsnews.com,"Iran leader says U.S. threats over nuclear program ""will get them nowhere""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-trump-nuclear-program-ayatollah-says-threats-will-get-us-nowhere/,"March 21, 2025 / 10:54 AM EDT/ CBS/AFP Tehran— Iran's supreme leader said Friday that U.S. threats against his country ""will get them nowhere,"" after President Trump warned of possible military action against the Islamic republic if it refuses to negotiate a new nuclear deal. ""The Americans should know threats will get them nowhere when confronting Iran,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in his live annual televised speech marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He said Americans ""and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap."" On March 7, Mr. Trumpsaid he had written to Khamenei, urging negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program and warning of potential military action if it refused. On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the letter was ""more of a threat"" but also said it appeared to offer opportunities. Araghchi added that Tehran was still weighing its response, which he said would be issued in the coming days. On Wednesday, U.S. news websiteAxios, citing a U.S. official and other sources, said Mr. Trump's letter set a ""two-month deadline for reaching a new nuclear deal."" The report did not specify a start or end date for the two months, and the White House has not confirmed that Mr. Trump's letter presented Tehran with a deadline. Mr. Trump announced the letter in an interview with Fox News, telling the network he ""would rather negotiate a deal"" with Iran, but warning: ""The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran — and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing — for them."" In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted to negotiate, adding that ""the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon."" Khamenei has previouslydismissed Mr. Trump's overturesfor talks, accusing the U.S. president of attempting to deceive global public opinion by portraying the United States as willing to negotiate and Iran as unwilling to engage. Mr. Trump, who began his second term in January, has reinstated his policy of ""maximum pressure"" against Tehran. During his first term, he unilaterally withdrew the United States in 2018 from the landmark nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on the Islamic republic. Iran initially adhered to the deal for a year after the U.S. withdrawal, but it then started scaling back its commitments, bolstering its uranium enrichment program. Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity level, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon. The most recent report by the United Nation's nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity — much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report. Both Israel and the United States have warned they will never allowIran to acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation. Late in August, Khamenei opened the door to possible talks with the U.S., saying there is ""no harm"" in engaging with the ""enemy."" However, more recently the supreme leader tempered that, saying negotiations with America were ""not intelligent, wise or honorable"" given the pressure applied by Mr. Trump. Efforts to revive the nuclear deal have so far failed. Iran ""definitely will not negotiate directly while facing pressure, threats, and increased sanctions,"" Araghchi said on Thursday. U.S. and Israeli officials are expected to meet next week to discuss Iran's nuclear program, and Russia, an ally of Iran that has been trying to improve ties with Washington since Mr. Trump's return to office, has offered to help broker a deal between Washington and Tehran. Speaking Friday in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Iran, ""like all other countries, has the right to develop the peaceful atomic sector, peaceful nuclear energy, and is taking important steps in this direction."" ""We are convinced that the problem of Iran's nuclear program should be resolved exclusively by peaceful political and diplomatic means, and we believe that everything necessary is available for this,"" Peskov said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""All that is needed is political will."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

www.cbsnews.com,"Mariah Carey didn't steal ""All I Want For Christmas Is You,"" judge says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-lawsuit/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 8:08 PM EDT/ CBS/AP A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" from other songwriters. Judge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial. In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana — who goes by the stage name Vince Vance — and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title. Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's ""disappointed"" in an email to The Associated Press. Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level ""nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges."" Stone and Powers' suit said their ""'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus."" They said there was an ""overwhelming likelihood"" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song — which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart — and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.Stone had claimedthat the song received ""extensive airplay"" during the 1993 Christmas season. After hearing from two experts for each side, Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar. Ramírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys ""made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support."" She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees. Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week — not just the holiday-themed — by airplay, sales and streaming. The song hasbroken streaming recordsand has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify. Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement — though not one that's gone to court — over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies. Carey previously made headlines when shetried to exclusively trademark the nickname""Queen of Christmas."" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Boardrejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark ""Princess Christmas"" and ""QOC."" Last month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fameannounced Careyas one of its 2025 nominees. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In his new memoir,""When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines""(to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades. Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Condé Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition. Read an excerpt below, anddon't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on""CBS Sunday Morning""March 23! ""When the Going Was Good"" by Graydon Carter Prefer to listen?Audiblehas a 30-day free trial available right now. We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time atVanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes—once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.  Jenner was tall and still good-looking—later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news. One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, ""What about Bruce Jenner?"" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, ""At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not inVanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?"" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said. To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author ofFriday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.  Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. ""The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'"" Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line ""Call Me Caitlyn."" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the  newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks—all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can ""break"" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.

www.cbsnews.com,Tom Hanks takes viewers through immersive experience to the moon,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-hanks-space-the-moonwalkers-apollo-missions/,"March 20, 2025 / 12:55 PM EDT/ CBS News Tom Hanks is taking people on a virtual ride to the moon. AtSpace Center Houston, visitors can experience an immersive 270-degree multi-screen view of the Apollo missions. ""The Moonwalkers: A Journey with Tom Hanks,"" was co-written and narrated by the Academy Award-winning actor. In the film, he tells the story of the Apollo missions, when humans landed on the moon six times up until 1972. For Hanks, it's a project that involves one of his longstanding passions. The Academy Award winning actor has lovedspacesince elementary school. ""I was sitting at home in December of 1968 when Bill Anders, Jim Lovell and Frank Borman broadcast a live TV message from the moon. I remember thinking to myself, 'I am so glad I'm 13-years-old and I'm alive at the moment that we as a species go from never being on the moon to having been to the moon and I bought all the little models and all the little toys,'"" Hanks said. As an actor and producer, he was drawn to projects like ""Apollo 13"" — he played Jim Lovell in the film — and an Apollo mini-series. So, when Hanks saw an art show at the immersive London venue,Lightroom, Hanks got an idea. ""I just said, 'you know, this could be the closest you could get to walking on the moon if you did something about Apollo here.'"" Hanks worked with Lightroom to create the experience, using mostly photos and film that the Apollo astronauts shot themselves, including a family photo that Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke left on the lunar surface. The images were handpicked by co-writer Chris Riley, a space documentarian. ""They're pristine, clear,"" Riley said. ""It really feels like you are there again."" The show also includes new interviews with astronauts of the Artemis program thatSpace Center Houston said on its website, ""will grant an insight into the return of crewed surface missions to the moon."" Hanks said he was starstruck when he had the opportunity to meet some astronauts. ""It's like meeting the Beatles. They're like, 'oh, hey Tom, I really enjoyed that show you made.' I can't believe these guys know my name,"" Hanks said. ""There isn't one of them who doesn't talk about how much fun it was to play in zero gravity."" Hanks tells the story of the moonwalkers as if recounting memories on a Sunday drive. While the stories are nostalgic for some, they're aspirational for others. ""It felt like you are on the moon somewhere where you could be doing anything you wanna be, having fun,"" said Zoila Rollins. The 7-year-old from the Dallas-Fort Worth area wants to be an astronaut, while her brother desires to be an engineer. Now, they're one small step closer. Astronaut Megan McArthur, who's spent 200 days on the International Space Station, felt a special connection to the project, saying she cried the first time she saw it and called the film ""emotionally immersive."" ""All of that moonwalking happened before I was born, except for the very, very last mission,"" McArthur said. ""I didn't know a lot of the details, in particular, the astronauts talking about the fun things that they got to do."" Hanks said he isn't concerned about commercialization or division impacting space travel. ""Here's one thing about 1968.What was going on in 1968? There was a war in Vietnam. There was a huge dynamic of competition and animosity between big chunks of the world. There was a massive amount of us versus them. That's 1968. Does that sound familiar?"" Hanks asked. ""And if you want, if you need, if you seek some degree of reassurance or inspiration or example, you can get that from the fact that four human beings are gonna start going back to the moon and they're gonna be staying longer. It will be an example of the best of us if we choose to make it so."" You can watch ""The Moonwalkers"" everyday at Space Center Houston. The film is going on a North American tour starting in Boston this summer.

www.cbsnews.com,"Smartphone addiction is leading to ""brain rot,"" doctors say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smart-phone-addiction-is-leading-to-brain-rot-doctors-say/,"March 19, 2025 / 7:53 PM EDT/ CBS News Asheville, North Carolina— Katy Paige Rosenberg, a freshman at the University of North Carolina Asheville, recently realized whattoo much scrollingon her phone was doing to her. She estimates she was probably spending about nine hours a dayon her phone. ""I was just kind of constantly on it,"" Rosenberg said. ""…I wasn't able to focus, because I would have to take out my phone every couple of minutes."" Stories like hers are familiar, but now it is possible to see the science behind it, according to Dr. Brent Nelson, a psychiatrist and the chief medical information officer for Southern California-based Newport Healthcare, which operates mental health treatment centers for teens nationwide. ""Smartphones have wide-reaching changes all over the brain,"" Nelson explains. He showed CBS News MRI images froma 2021 studyin Korea that showed major increases in brain activity — the negative effects ofsmartphone addiction. ""This is showing where the brain is working extra hard compared to a non-addicted brain when asked to do actually, a pretty simple task,"" Nelson said. In the study, the MRI images of addicted smartphone users' brains were so colorful, meaning so active, it made them less attentive and more easily distracted — what is now informally called ""brain rot."" ""Let's take school for example,"" Nelson said of how brain rot can manifest. ""You're sitting in class and you're trying to focus. They're going to be looking around, not attending to what the teacher is trying to teach them."" Nelson says emerging research points to even greater risks. ""We're just starting to see these changes, and we know they're connected to behavioral changes, depression, anxiety,"" Nelson said. ""The dangers are hiding in there."" Rosenberg agrees with that assessment. ""Social media had really influenced me in a lot of ways,"" Rosenberg said. ""TikTok would kind of push these videos of people popping an edible before school. And I was like, 'If I do this, maybe I'll be cool.' And I started self-medicating."" To deal with that, last year, she checked into a treatment facility. She believes that if she had not gone to treatment, ""I don't think I'd be here. It was really bad."" Rosenberg had to give up her phone in treatment. There, the Gen Zerfound other outlets, from drawing to playing guitar, that helped rewire her brain. The key, perhaps, were analog antidotes, reminiscent of another generation. Says Nelson: ""Playing in the dirt, drinking from the hose, sort of the Gen X kind of mentality, is shown to actually allow folks to recover, to feel better, to make it easier to kind of go about their day.""

www.cbsnews.com,China EV maker BYD says new cars can be charged in 5 minutes,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/byd-china-ev-maker-charge-five-minutes/,"March 18, 2025 / 11:54 AM EDT/ CBS News Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD says its new cars can be charged in almost the same time it takes to refill a gas engine vehicle at the pump, giving the world's top EV seller a major advantage in a highly competitive market. BYD's new 1 megawatt flash chargers can power vehicles in five to eight minutes, according to the company, which plans to build 4,000 new charging stations across China. Long charge times and so-called range anxiety around limited access to charging stations are often what holds motorists back from making the switch to electric cars. BYD says its new chargers can power vehicles for about 250 miles in five minutes. ""To completely solve users' anxiety over charging, our pursuit is to make the charging time for EVs as short as the refueling time for fuel vehicles,"" BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said in a statement. BYD shares soared 6% to a record high on the news Monday, raising its market value to almost $162 billion. Tesla shares, by contrast, sank 4.8%. BYD, short for Build Your Dreams, has started pre-selling its new range of vehicles, called Han L and Tang L. In 2024, BYD produced 1,777,965 battery-powered EVs, compared with Tesla which produced 1,773,443 vehicles that same year. Some EV fanshave souredon Elon Musk-owned Tesla, as Musk takes on a leading role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency,or DOGE. Tesla sales dropped 1.1% in 2024, marking the EV-maker's first annual sales decline in more than a decade. Some liberal-leaning customers say they have sold their Tesla's to distance themselves from Musk, while investors have also expressed concern that Musk's political actions are hurting the brand. With the billionaire at the helm, DOGE hasabruptly terminated thousands of federal workers, causing turmoil across multiple agencies. Tesla executives last weeksent an unsigned letterto the U.S. trade representative warning that President Trump's foreign trade policies could be harmful to domestic EV-makers. The company raised concerns over retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. that would make Tesla vehicles more expensive, and could dent overseas demand. The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

www.cbsnews.com,Bones of mammoths butchered for their tusks unearthed by archaeologists,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mammoths-butchered-ivory-tusks-unearthed-austria/,"March 21, 2025 / 9:41 AM EDT/ CBS News Bones of mammoths butchered for their ivory tusks 25,000 years ago were unearthed by archaeologists in Austria. Remains of five mammoths were found by archaeologists from the Austrian Academy of Sciencessaid Thursdayin a news statement. Researchers found mammoth bones in two areas, in Langmannersdorf an der Perschling, Lower Austria, located between St. Pölten and Tulln. Both zones, discovered about 50 feet apart, were densely packed with bones. In one area, researchers found evidence that the mammoths were butchered with stone tools. The bones were left in several layers. Remains of three mammoths were discovered in the second area, their tusks dismembered and complete. The discovery of the tusks indicated that the area was used for ivory processing, researchers said. The ivory from the tusks likely would have been turned into spearheads, researchers said. The find leads to a greater understanding of how humans and mammoths lived in the valley before the peak of the last Ice Age, according to senior researcher Marc Händel. The discoveries suggest humans living during this time period had a thorough understanding of mammoth habits and used this knowledge specifically for their hunting expeditions. ""The new discoveries provide valuable insights into the hunting and lifestyles of people of this period,"" Händel said in the news release. Humans hunted mammoths25,000 to 40,000 years ago, but researchers have very little knowledge of how they brought down the enormous beasts. Millions of mammoths roamed the earth before an onslaught of Ice Ages and human interactions led to their extinction about 10,000 years ago. Mammoth remains have been uncovered in the United States, with researchers unearthing more than20 bones in North Dakotalast year after miners found a 7-foot-tusk.

www.cbsnews.com,Venus will pass between the Earth and sun on Saturday,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venus-passes-between-earth-sun-inferior-conjunction-venus-kiss/,"March 20, 2025 / 2:21 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Venus will pass between the Earth and sun on Saturday during what's calledan inferior conjunction. The moment of conjunction will happen at around 9 p.m. EDT, but don't plan on seeing the linkup. The sight is extremely difficult to spot without special equipment and a trained eye. ""The glare from the sun makes it really, really difficult to see,"" said Michelle Nichols with Chicago's Adler Planetarium. A conjunction happenswhen two celestial bodies appear close together in the sky. It could be two planets, or a planet and the sun. Since Venus and Mercury are ""inferior"" planets compared with the Earth — meaning their orbits are closer to the sun, according to NASA — they create inferior conjunctions when swinging between the sun and our planet. For Venus, these events happen relatively often, every 19 months or so, according to the science siteEarthSky. The alignment during an inferior conjunction is approximate, as opposed to direct, which scientists would call a ""transit."" Those rarely happen. Geary Albright, an astronomer and professor at James Madison University, told The Associated Press some people colloquially refer to the type of conjunction happening this weekend as a ""Venus kiss,"" because of the planet's relatively close proximity to the Earth. Venus has phases just like the moon. Before and after the conjunction, Venus looks like a thin crescent — though only telescopes can see it. Those looking for signs of the transition can watch Venus move from the evening to morning sky Sunday. In the nights leading up to the conjunction, find a flat area and look near the horizon just after sunset to glimpse Venus before it sets. It appears as one of the brightest objects in the sky. After the conjunction, Venus will be visible in the morning sky just before sunrise. EarthSky scientists advised that people hoping to catch a glimpse of it look eastward on the horizon Sunday morning, about half an hour before sunrise. Some may be able to spot Venus shining brightly near the point where the sun ultimately emerges. Take precaution to not stare directly at the sun. While this weekend's event isn't much of a visual spectacle, scientists say it's an opportunity to track how the planets shift in space. ""Get a chance to get to know Venus,"" said Nichols. Paul McCartney's ""The Kiss of Venus"" was partly inspired by a book chapter describing the inferior conjunction. And two upcoming NASA missions will put a spotlight on Venus, investigating how it formed and why it turned out so different from Earth. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The force is enormous — it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful — it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate. And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced byAlbert Einsteinin his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year. Results presented at a meeting of theAmerican Physical SocietyWednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe. The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around. Called theDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements — exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape — support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning. ""It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,"" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research. Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations ""deeply intriguing."" ""It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,"" she said in a statement. It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. ""We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements"" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research. If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still. If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the ""Big Crunch."" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. ""Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,"" he said. ""Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know."" Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including theEuropean Space Agency's Euclid missionand the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon. It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.

www.cbsnews.com,What to know about the first day of spring,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-day-spring-2025-vernal-equinox/,"March 20, 2025 / 5:00 AM EDT/ CBS News The Northern Hemisphere is welcoming Spring 2025 on March 20, also known as the vernal equinox. The jump into spring has come with celebrations and traditions of rebirth around the world for centuries. Here's what to know about the first day of spring. Thefirst day of spring, or the vernal equinox, is determined by where the Earth is in its orbit around the sun. On this day, the Earth's axis is not tilted toward or away from the sun, causing roughly an equal amount of sunlight and dark hours at all latitudes, theNational Weather Serviceexplains. This year's first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere occurs precisely at 5:01 a.m. EST on March 20,according to NASA. The date and time of the equinox varies slightly from year to year. The Earth is not tilted toward or away from the sun on the first day of fall as well, also called the autumnal equinox. Onboth equinoxes, the sun is exactly above the equator. Once the Earth hits itsvernal equinox, the Northern Hemisphere moves into spring and the Southern Hemisphere moves into fall. The Earth sits at 23.5° on its axis, which is also what causes the seasons, the National Weather Service explains. When the Earth tilts toward the sun, the hemisphere closest to the sun gets more light hours during the day and vice versa. The longer the daylight lasts, the warmer the weather gets, but it's on a lag due to the time it takes the ground and water to heat up. The start of spring is celebrated in a variety of ways around the world. Here are a few examples: In Japan, the vernal equinox, orShunbun no Hi, is a public holiday to show appreciation for nature and welcome the start of cherry blossom season. The country also recognizes a seven-day period around the equinox called Higan, during which people pay respects to their ancestors, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan says on its website. In Mexico, one of the traditions is to visit thePyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán, according to the Smithsonian Science Education Center. Holi, the annual Hindu festival of colors, is another example of a celebration of spring, but it occurs on the last full moon in the Hindu month of Falgun, rather than being tied to the equinox. This year, Holi was held on March 13-14. Nowruz, meaning ""new day,"" is a new year and spring equinox celebration in Iran and other countries in Central Asia and elsewhere. Dating back to the Persian empire, ""it is an ancient celebration of life, rebirth, and the triumph of light over darkness,"" theUnited Nations says. The myth that you can balance an egg on the vernal equinox is not rooted in science. According to theAstronomical Society of the Pacific, the equinox has nothing to do with getting an egg to stand on its own. The good news is you can balance an egg any time of the year. The equinoxes occur when the sun is right above the equator, making day and night equally long. The solstices occur on the longest and shortest day of the year, respectively. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the North Pole tilts toward the sun and the winter solstice is when the South Pole tilts toward the sun. Both the equinoxes and solstices determine the start of a new season. The summer solstice begins on Friday, June 20, 2025, in the Northern Hemisphere. This will be the longest day of the year, thanks to the Earth's tilt. Amanda Cappelli is a digital producer for CBS News & Stations.

www.cbsnews.com,"Construction work unearths remains of 33 skeletons, woman's shoe",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/skeletons-found-dozens-executed-greece-civil-war/,"March 19, 2025 / 2:57 PM EDT/ CBS/AFP Construction work near one of Greece's most notorious prisons in Thessaloniki has unearthed the remains of dozens of people executed during the Greek Civil War era, relatives and officials said Wednesday. The grisly find included the discovery of footwear, including the remnants of a woman's shoe. So far, 33 skeletons have been found near Eptapyrgio prison northeast of the city, a former Byzantine-era fortress later known as Yedi Kule under Ottoman rule, city officialssaid in a statement. The Greek civil war lasted from 1946 to 1949 but executions of political prisoners held for alleged affiliation to the Greek communist party (KKE) continued for years thereafter. It is estimated that over 150,000 people lost their lives during the conflict, while around 800,000 people were displaced. CBS News journalistGeorge Polk, who had depicted the right-wing Greek government as corrupt, wasamong those killedduring the war. ""We are here today with very mixed feelings. We are happy because, even after 80 years of delay, we found the skeletons of the people who lost their lives for their ideas and for the country,"" said the local mayor of Sykies municipality, Simos Daniilidis. But he added that they were ""saddened, embittered, and angry"" because of the killings, which he termed ""inhumane, horrific, inconceivable things for today's Greek civilization."" One of the victims is believed to be a woman ""after traces of a woman's shoe were found,"" officials said. Several shoes worn by young adults were also unearthed, said the officials, who posted images of the footwear. The first remains were discovered in December during work on a city park. At the time, local officials ruled that the skeletons were of no archaeological interest, but Daniilidis, ""believing that there is enormous historical and political interest,"" requested that archaeologists excavate the wider area of the park. ""In the dark years of the civil war, the area was used for the execution of political prisoners, or the relocation of their bodies, as it was very near the prison and was uninhabited at the time,"" Sykies municipality said in a statement. Many of the victims are believed to have been killed for links with the KKE. A party delegation was present Wednesday to lay flowers at the site. With assistance from archaeologists, the excavation has uncovered clothes, jewelry and bullets. ""Thirty-three skeletons were discovered in four clusters. The skeletons are not in very good condition due to the soil and conditions. They are very fragile,"" said archaeologist Stavroula Tsevrini. The findings have been handed over to the police and efforts have already begun to identify the skeletons through DNA tests. The municipality has put out a call for relatives and descendants of civil war victims to step forward to speed up the identification process. The KKE party is compiling a list of executed political prisoners for publication. ""During the civil war in this region, approximately 400 people held in Yedi Kule as political prisoners were executed,"" said Spyros Kouzinopoulos, a journalist who has written a book on the issue, drawing on police archives. ""The executed were buried in mass graves without their relatives knowing where each one was buried. Here the area is full of remains,"" he told AFP. Miltiadis Parathyras said his uncle Rigas was executed at the location in March 1951. ""He was a captain in the (communist) Democratic Army, arrested in 1949 and held in prison for about two years. He was executed at the age of 24 along with five others in March 1951,"" he said. ""We don't know where he is buried. Where did they throw him?"" In astatement, the city said efforts to find other mass graves would continue ""so that all the skeletons of the people who lost their lives in this way during the dark years of the Civil War and were not given the honors traditionally attributed to the dead are found."" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

www.cbsnews.com,"Slain DEA agent's family sues Sinaloa cartel, drug kingpins over 1985 murder",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-dea-agent-enrique-kiki-camarena-sues-sinaloa-cartel/,"March 21, 2025 / 3:28 PM EDT/ CBS News The family of slain DEA agentEnrique ""Kiki"" Camarenasued Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and three alleged drug kingpins in federal court in California over his 1985 murder. The lawsuit – filed Thursday under a newdesignationby President Trump that classifies several drug cartels as terrorist organizations – seeks to hold Rafael Caro-Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo, Miguel Angel Felix-Gallardo and the Sinaloa cartel responsible for Camarena's death and provide relief to his family. Drug kingpinCaro-Quintero, alleged by the U.S. to have ordered the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena, continued to direct drug trafficking operations while in prison in Mexico after his conviction there in the murder. Court documents said he continued to work with the Sinaloa cartel. Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo and Miguel Angel Felix-Gallardo are also named as defendants in court documents for their alleged role in planning and directing Camarena's kidnapping, torture and murder. Caro-Quinterowas sent to the United States last month for allegeddrug traffickingand acts of extreme violence,along with 28 other prisonersrequested by the U.S. government. ""Today sends a message to every cartel leader, every trafficker, every criminal poisoning our communities: You will be held accountable,"" DEA Acting Administrator Derek S. Maltz said in a statement at the time. ""No matter how long it takes, no matter how far you run, justice will find you."" Fonseca-Carrillo is under house arrest in Mexico for his role in the murder, according to court documents and Felix-Gallardo was arrested in 1989 by Mexican authorities. After being convicted of Camarena's kidnapping and murder, he was sentenced to 40 years in a Mexican prison. Camarena was living in Guadalajara, Mexico, with his family and working as an undercover DEA agent when he was kidnapped on the street in broad daylight 40 years ago. He was headed to a luncheon with his wife Mika, according to court documents. Court documents said Mika went to the local Chinese restaurant in Guadalajara, where she had planned to meet her husband. She waited for him and eventually ate and left, assuming that his work had delayed him. She took care of her young sons that afternoon not knowing her husband was being brutally tortured. Mika went to bed and awoke the next morning to learn that he had not come home, court documents said. An autopsy suggested Camarena's death was caused by a puncture through the skull and into the brain, likely from a steel rebar or tire iron. Mexican forensic examiners said Camarena died from ""trauma craniocerebral and asphyxiation due to suffocation."" Cara Tabachnick is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

www.cbsnews.com,"Idaho murders suspect selfie puts focus on ""bushy eyebrows"" evidence",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/idaho-murders-suspect-bryan-kohberger-selfie-evidence-bushy-eyebrows/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 7:37 AM EDT/ CBS/AP A flurry of court documents filed this week in the case ofBryan Kohberger, the man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in late 2022, offers new details about how the case against him is shaping up. Among thosedocumentsrevealed by prosecutors is what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone just hours after the killings. Kohberger, 30, is accused in thestabbing deathsof Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, wasarrested in Pennsylvaniaweeks after the killings. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene. A defense attorney pushed to have the DNA evidence thrown out, but Judge Steven Hipplerdenied that request last month. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of murder in the Nov. 13, 2022 stabbing. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty if he is convicted. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. The killings shook the small farming community of about 25,000 people, which hadn't had a homicide in about five years. The trial was moved from rural northern Idaho to Boise after the defense expressed concerns that Kohberger couldn't get a fair trial in the county where the killings occurred. The newly filed documents include pretrial motions that will shape what evidence and expert testimony will be allowed at Kohberger's trial, which is set tobegin Aug. 11and expected to last more than three months. They show that prosecutors intend to introduce evidence of Kohberger's ""click history"" at Amazon.com showing hepurchased a Ka-Bar knife— a military-style, fixed-blade knife — along with a sheath and sharpener in March, eight months before the killings. A Ka-Bar knife was found next to one of the victims. Further, prosecutors say, the Amazon click history also shows Kohberger searched for a Ka-Bar knife in the days after the killings. ""Kohberger's click activity after the homicides makes it more probable (than it would be without the evidence) that Kohberger had a reason to search for a Ka-Bar knife and sheath after the homicides,"" prosecutors wrote. Kohberger's attorneyshave sought to exclude the online shopping history, saying it could be taken out of context or not reflect the influence of algorithms that recommend purchases. Prosecutors say they also intend to introduce what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone at 10:31 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 — just hours after the killings. In it, he is smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture. Aroommatewho was in the rental home, sleeping and intoxicated, told police she woke up and saw a man she didn't know — someone with ""bushy eyebrows"" who was wearing a face mask. Defense attorneys have asked the judge to exclude from the trial any description of the attacker having bushy eyebrows, saying that could prejudice the jury. ""If evidence of 'bushy eyebrows' is presented to the jury, the jury might well believe that Mr. Kohberger is guilty simply because of 'bushy eyebrows,'"" defense attorneys wrote. But prosecutors say the roommate's description is credible, and they want to introduce Kohberger's selfie because it shows his appearance shortly after the killings. ""Whether or not Bryan Kohberger can be described as having 'bushy eyebrows' is a factual determination to be decided by the jury,"" they wrote. Prosecutors have also presented a map that illustrates the locations where Kohberger's car was allegedly seen on surveillance video on the night of the murders, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reported. Judge Hippler has scheduled a hearing for April 9 to consider the pretrial motions. Among those to be decided are arguments over whether an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis would preclude Kohberger from being eligible for the death penalty if convicted, and over whether jurors should hearaudio of a 911 callmade by two women in the house roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up. The court has issued a gag order for everyone involved in the trial and won't allow cameras in the courtroom. Other motions have been filed ahead of the trial, including a sealed defense motion to take thedeath penaltyoff the table that cited autism spectrum disorder. Other sealed motions include one on whether theterms ""psychopath"" or ""sociopath""can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial. Last November, Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, said the details of the case show thedeath penaltyis merited. ""You've got four victims, all in one house — that's more than enough,"" Steve Goncalves said. Kristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter. ""If he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,"" she said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

www.cbsnews.com,2 convicted in plot to kill Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2-men-found-guilty-of-trying-to-kill-iranian-american-journalist-masih-alinejad/,"Updated on:  March 20, 2025 / 6:40 PM EDT/ CBS New York A jury has found two men guilty on all counts of trying to killIranian dissident Masih Alinejad, who works as a journalist and lives in New York City. Rafat Amirov and Polad Omaroy, both allegedly members of the Russian mob, will be sentenced in September and are facing decades behind bars. The charges against them included murder for hire, firearms possession and conspiracy to commit money laundering. ""I am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran. I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished,"" Alinejad said outside court. ""‏Right now, I am bombarded with emotions. I have cried, I have laughed, I have even danced. Because today is not just about my survival; it is about the defeat and humiliation of a regime that believes it can silence its critics with bullets. They failed. I am still here. And I will keep fighting until every criminal in that regime faces their reckoning,"" she added. The jury got the case just before 1 p.m. Thursday and later sent a note asking for testimony, but it was taking attorneys a while to gather materials. Before the jury even got the requested material, they sent another note saying they had reached a verdict. Prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments the government of Iran put a $500,000 bounty on the head of Alinejad, who lives in Brooklyn, to silence her, and that she has been the target of several plots by the Islamic Republic of Iran, including kidnapping. The man who said he was hired to kill her was arrested in 2022 and testified during the trial. Alinejad saidshe left the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2009after they took her passport and made her sign an agreement that she would not cover the election there. She moved to the U.S. and covered it from here. Alinejad, who was a contributor for Voice of America,took the stand on Tuesdayand was asked if the regime made accusations against her because of that contract. She told the court, ""I've been accused of being an agent of the CIA,"" MI6 and President Trump, among other things. In 2022, she was involved in two campaigns: boycotting Iranian sporting events, and a day of action calling on women in Iran to remove their hijab. She told the court, ""My social media is like my weapon."" She said her accounts were a place where she posted videos women sent her from Iran of themselves walking unveiled and getting harassed by the morality police. That same year, prosecutors say there was a plot by Iran's government to assassinate her. The man who took a plea deal and testified for the government said he was in the Russian mob and was hired to kill Alinejad. He took pictures and videos inside her home and was arrested nearby for rolling past a stop sign.An AK-47 was in his backseat. Alinejad described seeing him talking on a phone one day outside her home. ""I saw the big guy,"" she said. ""He was gigantic.""

www.cbsnews.com,Transcontinental cold case solved as 2018 murder victim is ID'd,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-trans-continental-cold-case-solved-interpol/,"Updated on:  March 20, 2025 / 5:32 PM EDT/ AFP A campaign to solve unexplained cold cases marked its first transcontinental success on Thursday with the police agency Interpolreportingit identified a Paraguayan woman found hanged in Spain in 2018. The France-based agency in a statement named the 33-year-old victim, previously known only as ""the woman in the chicken coop,"" as Ainoha Izaga Ibieta Lima. It hailed the discovery as ""the first successful trans-continental identification"" in the global agency's ""Identify Me"" campaignto identifymore than 40 women found dead in six European countries over recent decades. Interpol has been seeking public help to put names to the missing women. Police said that identification would mean they no longer have to identify the victims by their distinguishing features or apparel, such as ""the woman with the flower tattoo"" and ""the woman with the artificial nails."" Other names include the locations where their remains were discovered like ""the woman in the canal"" and ""the woman in the suitcase."" Izaga's brother reported her disappearance in 2019 and told investigators she had left Paraguay in 2013 for Spain. She was found hanged on a farm in Girona, northeastern Spain, in August 2018. There was nothing on her to identify her and the farm's inhabitants and neighbours did not know who she was or where she was from. After the launch of the Interpol appeal in 2023, Paraguayan authorities in March 2025 matched her fingerprints, supplied by Spain, to ones in their records. The campaign claimed its first European success in November 2023 when authorities identified Rita Roberts, a British woman found murdered in Antwerp, Belgium in 1992. Relatives recognized her by a tattoo. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza said in the statement that thecampaignwas ""about restoring dignity to victims and giving a voice to those affected by tragedy"".

www.cbsnews.com,Ex-Michigan coach charged with hacking to access students' private pics,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-weiss-former-michigan-quarterbacks-coach-charged-identity-theft-computer-hacking/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 12:23 AM EDT/ CBS Detroit Former University of Michigan quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss is facing 24 cybercrime charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The charges come more than two years afterWeiss was firedin January 2023 amid an investigation by university police into possible computer-access crimes at a football building. Weiss, 42, is charged with 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft. Officials allege that between 2015 and January 2023, Weiss hacked student-athlete databases of more than 100 colleges that were held by a third-party vendor. Once he gained access to the databases, Weiss allegedly downloaded ""personally identifiable information and medical data of more than 150,000 athletes."" Weiss is accused of primarily targeting female student-athletes. According to criminal records, Weiss ""researched and targeted these women based on their school affiliation, athletic history, and physical characteristics. His goal was to obtain private photographs and videos never intended to be shared beyond intimate partners."" Through the information that he obtained from the databases and his research, Weiss allegedly gained access to email and social media accounts as well as cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 student-athletes. He's also accused of illegally obtaining the same information of more than 1,300 additional students and alumni from colleges across the U.S. After obtaining access to the accounts, Weiss reportedly downloaded personal and intimate pictures and videos that were not meant to be shared publicly, officials say. ""Our office will move aggressively to prosecute computer hacking to protect the private accounts of our citizens,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in a news release. ""We stand ready with our law enforcement partners to bring those who illegally invade the privacy of others to justice."" If convicted, Weiss faces up to five years in prison on each count of unauthorized access to computers and two years on each count of aggravated identity theft. Weiss faces a mandatory two-year sentence if convicted of aggravated identity theft. ""Today's indictment of Matthew Weiss underscores the commitment and meticulous investigative efforts of our law enforcement professionals,"" said Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan. ""The FBI Detroit Cyber Task Force, in close collaboration with the University of Michigan Police Department, worked relentlessly on this case to safeguard and protect our community."" Weiss served as Michigan's quarterbacks coach in 2021 and as their co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach during the 2022 season. Before his time in Ann Arbor, Weiss was on the Baltimore Ravens coaching staff from 2009-2020. CBS News Detroit has reached out to the University of Michigan for comment and is waiting to hear back.

www.cbsnews.com,Venus will pass between the Earth and sun on Saturday,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venus-passes-between-earth-sun-inferior-conjunction-venus-kiss/,"March 20, 2025 / 2:21 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Venus will pass between the Earth and sun on Saturday during what's calledan inferior conjunction. The moment of conjunction will happen at around 9 p.m. EDT, but don't plan on seeing the linkup. The sight is extremely difficult to spot without special equipment and a trained eye. ""The glare from the sun makes it really, really difficult to see,"" said Michelle Nichols with Chicago's Adler Planetarium. A conjunction happenswhen two celestial bodies appear close together in the sky. It could be two planets, or a planet and the sun. Since Venus and Mercury are ""inferior"" planets compared with the Earth — meaning their orbits are closer to the sun, according to NASA — they create inferior conjunctions when swinging between the sun and our planet. For Venus, these events happen relatively often, every 19 months or so, according to the science siteEarthSky. The alignment during an inferior conjunction is approximate, as opposed to direct, which scientists would call a ""transit."" Those rarely happen. Geary Albright, an astronomer and professor at James Madison University, told The Associated Press some people colloquially refer to the type of conjunction happening this weekend as a ""Venus kiss,"" because of the planet's relatively close proximity to the Earth. Venus has phases just like the moon. Before and after the conjunction, Venus looks like a thin crescent — though only telescopes can see it. Those looking for signs of the transition can watch Venus move from the evening to morning sky Sunday. In the nights leading up to the conjunction, find a flat area and look near the horizon just after sunset to glimpse Venus before it sets. It appears as one of the brightest objects in the sky. After the conjunction, Venus will be visible in the morning sky just before sunrise. EarthSky scientists advised that people hoping to catch a glimpse of it look eastward on the horizon Sunday morning, about half an hour before sunrise. Some may be able to spot Venus shining brightly near the point where the sun ultimately emerges. Take precaution to not stare directly at the sun. While this weekend's event isn't much of a visual spectacle, scientists say it's an opportunity to track how the planets shift in space. ""Get a chance to get to know Venus,"" said Nichols. Paul McCartney's ""The Kiss of Venus"" was partly inspired by a book chapter describing the inferior conjunction. And two upcoming NASA missions will put a spotlight on Venus, investigating how it formed and why it turned out so different from Earth. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

""The Moonwalkers: A Journey with Tom Hanks,"" was co-written and narrated by the Academy Award-winning actor. In the film, he tells the story of the Apollo missions, when humans landed on the moon six times up until 1972. For Hanks, it's a project that involves one of his longstanding passions. The Academy Award winning actor has lovedspacesince elementary school. ""I was sitting at home in December of 1968 when Bill Anders, Jim Lovell and Frank Borman broadcast a live TV message from the moon. I remember thinking to myself, 'I am so glad I'm 13-years-old and I'm alive at the moment that we as a species go from never being on the moon to having been to the moon and I bought all the little models and all the little toys,'"" Hanks said. As an actor and producer, he was drawn to projects like ""Apollo 13"" — he played Jim Lovell in the film — and an Apollo mini-series. So, when Hanks saw an art show at the immersive London venue,Lightroom, Hanks got an idea. ""I just said, 'you know, this could be the closest you could get to walking on the moon if you did something about Apollo here.'"" Hanks worked with Lightroom to create the experience, using mostly photos and film that the Apollo astronauts shot themselves, including a family photo that Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke left on the lunar surface. The images were handpicked by co-writer Chris Riley, a space documentarian. ""They're pristine, clear,"" Riley said. ""It really feels like you are there again."" The show also includes new interviews with astronauts of the Artemis program thatSpace Center Houston said on its website, ""will grant an insight into the return of crewed surface missions to the moon."" Hanks said he was starstruck when he had the opportunity to meet some astronauts. ""It's like meeting the Beatles. They're like, 'oh, hey Tom, I really enjoyed that show you made.' I can't believe these guys know my name,"" Hanks said. ""There isn't one of them who doesn't talk about how much fun it was to play in zero gravity."" Hanks tells the story of the moonwalkers as if recounting memories on a Sunday drive. While the stories are nostalgic for some, they're aspirational for others. ""It felt like you are on the moon somewhere where you could be doing anything you wanna be, having fun,"" said Zoila Rollins. The 7-year-old from the Dallas-Fort Worth area wants to be an astronaut, while her brother desires to be an engineer. Now, they're one small step closer. Astronaut Megan McArthur, who's spent 200 days on the International Space Station, felt a special connection to the project, saying she cried the first time she saw it and called the film ""emotionally immersive."" ""All of that moonwalking happened before I was born, except for the very, very last mission,"" McArthur said. ""I didn't know a lot of the details, in particular, the astronauts talking about the fun things that they got to do."" Hanks said he isn't concerned about commercialization or division impacting space travel. ""Here's one thing about 1968.What was going on in 1968? There was a war in Vietnam. There was a huge dynamic of competition and animosity between big chunks of the world. There was a massive amount of us versus them. That's 1968. Does that sound familiar?"" Hanks asked. ""And if you want, if you need, if you seek some degree of reassurance or inspiration or example, you can get that from the fact that four human beings are gonna start going back to the moon and they're gonna be staying longer. It will be an example of the best of us if we choose to make it so."" You can watch ""The Moonwalkers"" everyday at Space Center Houston. The film is going on a North American tour starting in Boston this summer.

www.cbsnews.com,"New evidence about dark energy may be ""cusp of a major discovery""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dark-energy-changing-new-observations-universe-fate/,"Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 9:43 AM EDT/ CBS/AP Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force calleddark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. The force is enormous — it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful — it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate. And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced byAlbert Einsteinin his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year. Results presented at a meeting of theAmerican Physical SocietyWednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe. The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around. Called theDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements — exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape — support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning. ""It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,"" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research. Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations ""deeply intriguing."" ""It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,"" she said in a statement. It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. ""We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements"" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research. If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still. If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the ""Big Crunch."" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. ""Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,"" he said. ""Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know."" Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including theEuropean Space Agency's Euclid missionand the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon. It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.

www.cbsnews.com,Sunset on the moon seen in stunning images taken by lunar lander,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunset-on-the-moon-blue-ghost-lander-firefly-aerospace-nasa/,"Updated on:  March 19, 2025 / 11:02 AM EDT/ CBS News A lunar lander has completed its two-week mission and sent spectacular sunset images as a ""final goodbye"" back to Earth. TheBlue Ghost Mission 1 landerwas launched by Firefly Aerospace in mid-January and landed on the moon on March 2. It was the firstsuccessful commercial moon landing. The lander delivered 10 NASA science and delivery payloads to the Mare Crisium basin, which is a lava-flooded region on the near side of the moon formed by an asteroid impact. The payloads were delivered as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs, NASA said in a news release, and were used to collect data and perform other scientific operations on the moon. While making the deliveries, the Blue Ghost lander experienced one lunar day. During the course of that day, it captured several images and videos. It imaged a total solar eclipse from the surface of the moon and also took pictures of the sunset. In apost on social media, Firefly Aerospace referred to the sunset picture as the lander's farewell. ""Sunsets hit differently on the Moon!"" the company wrote, alongside several photos, including those of the sunset and the eclipse. ""More images below of the horizon glow that comes to life just above the Moon's surface as the sun goes down. This milestone embodies all the achievements from this historic Firefly mission. Thank you #BlueGhost for the final goodbye. Until next time!"" Sunsets hit differently on the Moon! More images below of the horizon glow that comes to life just above the Moon’s surface as the sun goes down. This milestone embodies all the achievements from this historic Firefly mission. Thank you#BlueGhostfor the final goodbye. Until…pic.twitter.com/qfmETBIVDT During the mission, the lander transmitted 119 gigabytes of data back to Earth, NASA said. The instruments carried by the lander performed many first-of-their kind science and technology demonstrations, including starting the moon's deepest robotic planetary subsurface thermal probe and using an X-ray imager to study the interaction of solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. ""Operating on the Moon is complex; carrying 10 payloads, more than has ever flown on a (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) delivery before, makes the mission that much more impressive,"" Joel Kearns, the deputy associate administrator for exploration at NASA's, Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. ""Teams are eagerly analyzing their data, and we are extremely excited for the expected scientific findings that will be gained from this mission."" This mission set a record for the longest commercial mission, NASA said. The Commercial Lunar Payload Services is set to send more than 50 instruments to various parts of the moon, the space agency said. Kerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

www.cbsnews.com,Notable Deaths in 2025,https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/notable-deaths-in-2025/,"Updated on:  March 14, 2025 / 11:01 AM EDT/ CBS News A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity. By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery. A political moderate, Republican SenatorAlan Simpson(Sept. 2, 1931-March 14, 2025) served three terms representing Wyoming, from 1979 to 1997, and played a key role in rallying GOP support around the party's legislative agenda. At 6-foot-7 (he was the tallest Senator up to that time) with a quick wit, Simpson was able to bridge partisan impasses, and foster relationships across the aisle at a time of increasing political acrimony. ""The word 'politics' is interesting,""he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2018, ""because it comes from the Greek, you know that?Poly, meaning many, andtics, meaning blood-sucking insects!"" Simpson maintained his own views even when they crossed Republican orthodoxy. A deficit hawk, Simpson also supported abortion rights. He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others. After leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he urged college students to become politically involved. In 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. One of Simpson's closest friends was a Democrat, Norman Mineta, a Congressman from California who also served as Commerce Secretary under President Bill Clinton and as Transportation Secretary under President George W. Bush. The two had met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyo., during World War II. Simpson and Menieta bonded over playing pranks on the other Scouts, including a bully whose tent they sabotaged: ""It was raining to beat hell and we kinda channeled the water down into this guy's tent,"" Simpson told ""Sunday Morning."" The two friends would not see each other until decades later, when Mineta (who had become Mayor of San Jose, Calif.), won election to Congress. ""And there we were, and we started right over just like that,"" Simpson said. Mineta said, ""We'd have fights in the sub-committee, the full committee, and yet we'd slap each other on the back and say, 'Come on, let's go have dinner, let's go have a drink.' And they don't do that [today]. They just don't have that kind of personal relationship."" In 1988 Simpson and Mineta joined forces to help pass the Civil Liberties Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which for the very first time formally apologized to Japanese-Americans, and granted reparations to those who had been imprisoned. Bestselling authorJoseph Wambaugh(Jan. 22, 1937-Feb. 28, 2025), a former Los Angeles police officer, wrote 11 novels about crime and policing as well as non-fiction works, several of which were adapted for films and television, including ""The New Centurions,"" ""The Blue Knight,"" and ""The Choirboys,"" as well as the true-crime stories ""The Onion Field"" and ""Echoes in the Darkness."" He was also the co-creator of the anthology series ""Police Story,"" which debuted on NBC in 1973. Other novels included ""The Black Marble,"" ""The Glitter Dome,"" ""The Delta Star"" and ""The Secrets of Harry Bright."" He was the winner of three Edgar Awards. The son of a police officer, Wambaugh (a Marine veteran who originally intended to become an English teacher) drew on his own experiences as an L.A. police officer for his writing, as well as stories heard from other veterans of the force. He was a detective sergeant when his first novel, ""The New Centurions,"" was published in 1971. By the time ""The Onion Field"" was published, his celebrity had become so great it interfered with his police work. He quit the LAPD after 14 years on the job and began writing full-time. Ina 1997 symposium at the University of California, Wambaugh said, ""Police procedurals generally tell how a cop acts on the job, and I was more interested in how the job acts on the cop, and the cop's head. So, from the very beginning that was my interest. That's what I wrote about, and that's what made my stuff different, because some of my stories, police stories, have virtually no action whatsoever. No gunplay. Nothing much happening, except what's happening inside the head of the man or woman doing the job."" Musician and vocalistDavid Johansen(Jan. 9, 1950-Feb. 28, 2025) was known both for his role in the glam-protopunk band the New York Dolls, and for his stage persona as an over-the-top pompadour-styled lounge singer who performed swing and blues-infused pop under the name Buster Poindexter. While the New York Dolls didn't achieve mainstream success (internal strife and addictions tore at the founding members, who produced two albums before breaking up), it influenced other groups in the '70s, including the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Kiss and Guns N' Roses. In 2004 Johansen reconstituted the Dolls with new players (four of its members had died by then) for England's Meltdown Festival, which led to three more albums. In the 1980s, Johansen, as Buster Poindexter, had a hit with ""Hot, Hot, Hot,"" and a cover of ""Hit the Road, Jack."" By 2000, he was back to recording under his own name, with the albums ""David Johansen and the Harry Smiths"" and ""Shaker."" He also acted in the films ""Candy Mountain,"" ""Let It Ride,"" ""Freejack,"" ""Married to the Mob,"" the Bill Murray comedy ""Scrooged"" (as the Ghost of Christmas Past), and the TV series ""Oz,"" and hosted a weekly show on Sirius Satellite Radio. Ina 2014 profile for Interview Magazine, Johansen said he began the Buster Poindexter character while performing a series of cabaret shows at Tramps, a Lower East Side bar. ""I used that moniker because I didn't want people to be coming in and yelling for songs that I was famous for; I could just do what I wanted,"" he said. Then, ""without any publicity or anything, it became very popular, so I started doing weekends there. It wasn't a plan or anything, it just happened."" He was insouciant about reactions to the lounge music he performed as Buster: ""Well, like a lot of stuff I do, 10 years later it becomes popular,"" he told Interview. In 1972, Soviet-era world chess grandmasterBoris Spassky(Jan. 30, 1937-Feb. 27, 2025) lost his world championship title to American Bobby Fischer in a televised tournament in Reykjavik, Iceland, that became an international sensation during the Cold War. Then 29 years old, Fischer, a chess genius from Brooklyn, lost and forfeited the first two games, then beat Spassky in the third. Fischer would overcome Spassky in the 21-game tournament, becoming the first American to attain the world chess title, after the Soviet Union had dominated the game for decades. [Fischer would later forfeit the title by refusing to defend it.] Ina 2016 interview with Sport-Express newspaper, Spassky said that when he played his third match against Fischer, he was pressured by the chairman of the Sports Committee to stop the tournament early: ""He instructed me what to do: 'File a protest against this, against that, then just fly away ...' But I resisted – I wanted to play! What a fool I was."" In 1974, in New York City, Spassky simultaneously played 41 competitors, ranging from chess experts to novices (including a six-year-old). Beginning each game with the move Pawn-to-King 4, Spassky won 40 matches and drew one. He emigrated to France in 1976, but in 2012 he returned to Moscow. In his 2016 interview, Spassky said his years in the late 1960s and early '70s as world champion were his unhappiest, because of the responsibility he held from winning: ""You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title off me,"" he said. ""Honestly, I don't recall that day as unhappy. On the contrary, I've thrown off a very strong burden and breathed freely."" Two-time Oscar-winnerGene Hackman(Sept. 1, 2023-death announced Feb. 27, 2025) was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as ""The French Connection,"" ""The Conversation"" and ""Unforgiven,"" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three ""Superman"" films. Hailed as one of the best actors of the era, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (""I Never Sang for My Father""), crime dramas (""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Mississippi Burning""), thrillers (""The Conversation,"" ""No Way Out""), and triumphant tales of sports (""Hoosiers""), to comedies (""Get Shorty,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums""). Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a sinister, unforeseeable edge, the way an animal's behavior is not entirely predictable. ""The French Connection"" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers — like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale. He won his first Academy Award, and his star power led him to both big-budget studio fare (headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film ""The Poseidon Adventure""), and small character dramas (such as ""Scarecrow,"" opposite Al Pacino). In 1992, the year he appeared in Clint Eastwood's revised western ""Unforgiven"" (as the brutal sheriff ""Little"" Bill Daggett), he also starred on Broadway in ""Death and the Maiden"" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols. Hackman was less ""method-y"" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character — fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years – took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: ""Vesuvius."" When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with, and decided to try writing one — a pirate story. Picking different starting points, Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a café to go over their work. ""I would have some pages, he would have some pages,""Hackman told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2000. ""We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work, and decided where we were going to go from there."" ""The Wake of the Perdido Star,"" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well, but received mixed reviews. He told ""Sunday Morning,"" ""The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me — and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before."" He retired from the screen in 2004, and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He turned down most interview requests, but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of ""The French Connection,""he shared with the New York Postthe revelation that he'd only watched the film once. ""Filmmaking has always been risky — both physically and emotionally — but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,"" he wrote in an email. As a child actress,Michelle Trachtenberg(Oct. 11, 1985-Feb. 26, 2025) starred in 1996's ""Harriet the Spy,"" playing Louise Fitzhugh's diminutive detective. She went on to star in two popular TV series, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Gossip Girl."" Trachtenberg was 8 years old when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete,"" which ran from 1994 to 1996 on Nickelodeon. She also appeared with Matthew Broderick in the film ""Inspector Gadget."" In 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of ""Buffy,"" playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar's vampire slayer. (She and Gellar had both worked together on ""All My Children"" in the mid-'90s.) Trachtenberg received a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2001 for hosting Discovery's ""Truth or Scare."" On ""Gossip Girl,"" Trachtenberg played the scheming Georgina Sparks. ""It's definitely a lot more fun than playing the good girl,""she told Seventeen magazine in 2009. ""I never understood why some actors don't want to play villains or evil characters."" Her other TV credits included ""Six Feet Under,"" ""The Circuit,"" ""Mercy,"" ""Love Bites,"" ""Weeds,"" ""NCIS: Los Angeles,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and ""Sleepy Hollow."" Movie roles included ""Euro Trip,"" ""Ice Princess,"" ""Beautiful Ohio,"" ""17 Again,"" ""Black Christmas,"" ""Mysterious Skin,"" ""Sister Cities,"" and ""Killing Kennedy,"" in which she played Marina Oswald, wife of the president's assassin. Grammy-winning singer and pianistRoberta Flack(Feb. 10, 1937-Feb. 24, 2025) was one of the top recording artists of the 1970s, with such hits as ""Killing Me Softly With His Song,"" ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" and ""The Closer I Get To You."" Classically trained, Flack earned a full scholarship at age 15 to Howard University, then taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools and performed in jazz clubs. She was discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that ""her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known."" With her soft soprano voice, Flack's performances were measured and reflective, turning up-tempo songs into warm, soulful ballads. Signed to Atlantic Records, her debut album, ""First Take"" — a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz – was released in 1969. One track was a love song by English folk artist Ewan MacColl — music Flack had taught during her years as an educator. ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" would make her a star, when her cover of the song, used in the Clint Eastwood film ""Play Misty for Me,"" was released in 1972 as a single and spent six weeks at No. 1. It won her a Grammy for record of the year. The following year she became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with ""Killing Me Softly With His Song."" Flack had a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet ""Tonight, I Celebrate My Love,"" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet ""Set the Night to Music."" In the mid-'90s, the Fugees won a Grammy for their cover of ""Killing Me Softly."" In 2015,Flack talked with the Guardianabout the cover of ""Killing Me Softly"": "" I love hip-hop. In fact I love music, period. Lauryn Hill recorded 'Killing Me Softly' [with the Fugees] and did an excellent job. She's a  genius musician and so is Wyclef Jean who co-produced it. I'm not going  to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone  else covers it; I'm a music lover who has enough experience and common  sense to know that it's good they recorded it and had a hit."" Overall, Flack won five Grammys and eight more nominations, and received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020. She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York. On Nov. 22, 1963, Secret Service AgentClint Hill(Jan. 4, 1932-Feb. 21, 2025) was accompanying the presidential motorcade when shots were fired in Dealey Plaza, striking President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connolly. Images from that day show Hill jumping atop the presidential limousine to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who had begun climbing out of the open-top vehicle. Hill, assigned to the first lady, was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car when he jumped off, and pulled himself onto the trunk of the limousine as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy back into her seat as the limousine sped off to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Haunted by memories of the assassination, Hill, who'd joined the Secret Service in 1958, retired early, andin a 1975 interview with ""60 Minutes,""told Mike Wallace he blamed himself for JFK's death, saying that if only he'd reacted ""five-tenths of a second faster,"" the president would be alive. ""And I'll live with that to my grave."" Twenty years later,in a follow-up interview for ""60 Minutes,""and in a book, ""Five Days in November,"" Hill shared his sense of failure in protecting the president that led him, in 1990, to return to Dallas. ""I walked the area of Dealey Plaza, I went up into the School Book Depository, I went up to the sixth floor, and I did everything I could to examine exactly the situation: the angles, the weather, all the conditions that existed that day. I came away with the conclusion that on that particular day, all the advantages had gone to the shooter — we didn't have any — and that I had done everything I could to try to prevent the assassination from happening. But I still feel today a sense of failure and responsibility because that was our job: to keep the president safe, to protect him at all costs. And on that particular day, we were unable to do that."" The sense of failure fueled a depression that he said damaged his relationships with his family and friends and contributed to the demise of his marriage. ""I drank heavily and I smoked a lot,"" he said. ""It was the only thing that would relieve the pain and the anguish that I had, thinking about what had happened in Dallas in 1963. A friend of mine was a doctor, came to me and said, 'Look, Clint, if you don't change what you're doing, you're going to die. You have a choice to make: live or die.' And I chose to live. And so, it was those words from that doctor that made me realize life was too precious to give up on."" Hill co-authored several books, wrote a 2005 memoir, ""Between You and Me,"" and became a public speaker about his experiences. He also remarried. In his follow-up conversation with ""60 Minutes,""Hill read a letterthat had been written to him by a viewer following his 1975 interview: ""It is a day I shall never forget, nor shall I forget the people so deeply involved in the events of that day. And as I watched you on '60 Minutes,' I wanted to reach out and wrap you in my arms to offer some comfort. But no one who suffered that tremendous loss that day can even feel comfort, and I know you feel that."" AuthorTom Robbins(July 22, 1932-Feb. 9, 2025) was a literary prankster whose screwball novels included ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"" ""Another Roadside Attraction,"" ""Still Life with Woodpecker,"" ""Jitterbug Perfume,"" and ""Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas."" A dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate), Robbins joined the Air Force for a tad, and moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early 1960s. He was writing for the Seattle Times when a Doubleday editor advanced him $2,500 for what became ""Another Roadside Attraction"" (published in 1971). It became a hit in paperback, and was followed by ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"" featuring Sissy Hankshaw, a young lady with ridiculously enormous thumbs who becomes a proficient hitchhiker. It sold more than 1 million copies. Labeled ""the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters"" by People magazine, Robbins produced farcical works that captured the wide-open spirit of the 1960s. He understood the era, having lived it so fully — dropping acid, hitchhiking coast to coast, and traveling from Tanzania to the Himalayas. He published eight novels, a novella, and a 2014 memoir (""Tibetan Peach Pie: A True Account of an Imaginative Life""). His last novel was 2003's ""Villa Incognito."" ""Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,"" he wrote in ""Tibetan Peach Pie."" ""I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal."" In the 1990s, when the FBI sought clues to the identity of the Unabomber, they happened upon Robbins' 1980 novel ""Still Life with Woodpecker,"" whose plot features an outlaw bomber. Robbins alleged that the agency sent two agents, both attractive women, to interview him. ""The FBI is not stupid!"" he liked to say. ""They knew my weakness!"" Beyond his frequent appearances on the New York stage, Tony Award-nominated actorTony Roberts(Oct. 22, 1939-Feb. 7, 2025) was familiar from acting in several Woody Allen films, including ""Annie Hall."" He made his first Broadway appearance in ""Something About a Soldier,"" in 1962. When his then-girlfriend got the position of understudy to Elizabeth Ashley in ""Barefoot in the Park,"" she convinced producers to hire Roberts as the understudy to Robert Redford's understudy. Then came a fateful Broadway Show League softball game: ""The guy I was understudying got up at the plate and hit a single, but he tried to stretch it into a double, slid into second base, and then was holding onto his ankle in great pain. His broken ankle was my big break,""he told Broadway World in 2015. ""I played Redford's role for two weeks and when he left the cast sometime later, I replaced him."" Roberts earned a Tony nomination for the musical ""How Now, Dow Jones,"" and a second for the Woody Allen-scripted ""Play It Again, Sam."" Other stage credits included ""Take Her, She's Mine,"" ""Never Too Late,"" ""The Last Analysis,"" ""Don't Drink the Water,"" ""How Now, Dow Jones,"" ""Promises, Promises,"" ""Sugar"" (an adaptation of the film ""Some Like It Hot""), ""Absurd Person Singular,"" ""They're Playing Our Song,"" ""Doubles,"" ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ""Jerome Robbins' Broadway,"" ""The Seagull,"" ""The Sisters Rosensweig,"" ""Victor/Victoria,"" ""Cabaret,"" ""The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,"" ""Xanadu,"" and ""The Royal Family."" He joined Allen and Diane Keaton in the film version of ""Play It Again, Sam"" (directed by Herbert Ross), and went on to appear in ""Annie Hall,"" ""Stardust Memories,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" and ""Radio Days."" Other film credits include ""Serpico,"" ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,"" ""Just Tell Me What You Want,"" ""Amityville 3-D,"" and ""Seize the Day."" He recounted his long career in a 2015 autobiography, ""Do You Know Me?"" The poster designs of graphic artistDavid Edward Byrd(April 4, 1941-Feb. 3, 2025), for artists like The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Traffic, Ravi Shankar, The Grateful Dead, The Rolling Stones, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Prince and Van Halen, perfectly captured the psychedelic era of the 1960s and '70s. Byrd also created ovation-worthy posters for Broadway, for the musicals ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" ""Follies,"" ""Godspell"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors."" One admirer described Byrd's work as ""kind of like Art Nouveau on acid.""Born in Tennessee and raised in Florida, Byrd studied at the Boston Museum School and Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He later taught at the Pratt Institute and the School of Visual Arts in New York City. In 1968 he was asked to create a poster for Bill Graham's Fillmore East in New York's East Village. This led to a series of graphics for concerts, tours, and record albums. He won a Grammy for the packaging of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's version of The Who's ""Tommy."" The ""Follies"" poster was inspired by an evocative portrait of Marlene Dietrich, painted in bright colors with a crack through her face. It led to numerous Broadway assignments. He also designed the movie poster for the 1975 film version of Nathanael West's ""The Day of the Locust."" Beginning in the 1980s, he served as the art director for The Advocate. He published an autobiography, ""Poster Child,"" in 2023. Ina 2016 interview for Carnegie Mellon University, Byrd said, ""When you created a rock poster, the subject matter was neither here nor there. It had to be wild, it had to be mysterious, it had to have fantastic colors, and it had to be difficult to read. I wanted to establish a look that really punched you in the face."" One of the most accomplished men's figure skaters in history,Dick Button(July 18, 1929-Jan. 30, 2025) was also familiar as a broadcaster, covering skating and Olympic events for more than four decades. In 1946, at age 16, he was the youngest U.S. men's champion, and two years later he won gold at the St. Moritz Olympics — the first American to win the men's event. The winner of five consecutive world championships (1948-1952), Button performed the first double axel in any competition. In 1952, Button (then a student at Harvard, where he earned a law degree) won a second gold at the Oslo Games, with the first triple jump in competition. He also invented the flying camel spin. He gave up his eligibility as an amateur to perform in the Ice Capades. After the 1961 world championships were canceled following a plane crash that killed the entire U.S. figure skating team, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on ""Wide World of Sports."" Button joined the network as a commentator, bringing figure skating to a mainstream TV audience as an Emmy-winning sports analyst. Button later ran professional skating events, including the World Professional Figure Skating Championships, and the Challenge of Champions. His company, Candid Productions, helped to produce programs such as ""Battle of the Network Stars"" and ""The Superstars."" Ina 2014 interview with The New York Times, Button said he never tired of talking about skating: ""Skating encourages you to learn about so many art forms: dance, performance, athleticism, history, choreography, even haute couture. How could anyone tire of it?"" He didn't tire of describing his own legacy: ""I was a skater with a lot of hair who too frequently wore sassy jackets,"" he said. She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. ButMarianne Faithfull(Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit ""As Tears Go By,"" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as ""Broken English,"" ""Dangerous Acquaintances,"" and ""Easy Come, Easy Go."" The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, ""As Tears Go By."" Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. ""I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,""she told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2009. ""I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole."" She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: ""I think that's the worst feeling in the world,"" she told Anthony Mason. She played up the ""bad girl"" image by acting in the film ""Girl on a Motorcycle."" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not. She fell into heroin addiction. She said, ""It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was 8 or 10 –I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!""she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, ""Broken English."" ""I became myself,"" she said, ""and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting."" It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in ""Paris, Je T'aime,"" ""Marie Antoinette,"" and ""Faces in the Crowd."" Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: ""I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing."" The works of the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and humoristJules Feiffer(Jan. 26, 1929-Jan. 17, 2025) included a long-running comic strip, plays, screenplays and children's books in which he chronicled childhood, urban angst, politics, sexism, war, and other topics. To each he brought a sharp wit and acute observations of the personal and political quandaries that colored 20th century life. As Feiffer explained to the Chicago Tribune in 2002, his work dealt with ""communication and the breakdown thereof, between men and women, parents and children, a government and its citizens, and the individual not dealing so well with authority."" After attending the Pratt Institute in New York City, Feiffer drew his first comic strip, ""Clifford,"" from the late 1940s until he was drafted in 1951. After leaving the Army, he returned to cartooning, and joined The Village Voice beginning in 1956. Feiffer became a fixture of the New York City alternative weekly newspaper. His satirical strip, ""Feiffer,"" ran there for more than four decades. He also wrote novels, plays and screenplays, to convey ideas, he told Time magazine, that he felt he couldn't address ""in six panels of a cartoon."" His book ""Passionella"" became the basis of the musical ""The Apple Tree."" He won an Obie Award for 1967's ""Little Murders,"" and wrote ""The White House Murder Case,"" ""A Think Piece,"" ""Knock Knock,"" ""Grown Ups,"" and ""A Bad Friend."" He wrote ""Carnal Knowledge"" as both a play and a film, directed by Mike Nichols. He also scripted Robert Altman's film based on the ""Popeye"" comic strip. One of his most enduring works was his illustrations for ""The Phantom Tollbooth,"" published in 1961. The adventure story of a bored child who is transformed upon entering a magic tollbooth, it was written by Feiffer's friend, Norton Juster. ""Norton would read me what he had written,""Feiffer told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2012, ""and in order to avoid doing the work I was supposed to doing, I began sketching characters for the 'Phantom Tollbooth.' And as it evolved, it just seemed like a natural act, that if this book was going to be Illustrated, why not by me?"" In six undistinguished seasons as a catcher in the majors,Bob Uecker(Jan. 26, 1934-Jan. 16, 2025) played for four teams, with a career batting average of .200. But for a half-century as a play-by-play announcer, the Milwaukee native was a mascot for his city, and for the sport at which he never quite excelled, his enthusiasm and humor earning him the nickname ""Mr. Baseball."" Hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as a scout, Uecker demonstrated his lack of ability in that department. But then, the team's owner moved him to the broadcast booth, where Uecker stayed for 54 years. A favorite Uecker line? ""'Juuuuusta bit outside.' That's where my wife put me a lotta times!"" His dry wit fueled his second career as an actor, comedian, commercial pitchman, and perennial guest on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show."" He notably played announcer Harry Doyle in the ""Major League"" movies. In 2024, Uecker told ""Sunday Morning""he shared a bond with players on the field: ""I played the game. So, I know how hard it is. I know how tough it is. ... The game celebrations, when we win, that's a big part of it, man, to be able to walk into that clubhouse and be with 'em."" Writer, director and painterDavid Lynch(Jan. 20, 1946-Jan. 15, 2025) was a remarkable cinematic visionary, whose films ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Lost Highway,"" and the TV series ""Twin Peaks"" were highly stylized dream states, evoking lost innocence, eroticism, and the roiling mysteries that exist underneath placid, peaceful exteriors. His films' interior logic would invariably prompt more questions than answers, but the imagery and sonic sensations he mastered would generate a tremendous devotion from his fellow filmmakers and audiences. A Montana native, Lynch studied at the American Film Institute and turned his thesis project into his first feature, ""Eraserhead,"" a black-and-white experimental film about parenthood. Its exceptional photography and sound design made it a cult favorite. On the basis of ""Eraserhead,"" Lynch was hired by Mel Brooks' production company to write and direct his first Hollywood feature, ""The Elephant Man."" Lynch earned two Oscar nominations. He turned down George Lucas' offer to direct the third ""Star Wars"" film, ""Return of the Jedi,"" and instead tackled Frank Herbert's ""Dune."" A visual feast, the film was a critical failure. But his relationship with producer Dino de Laurentiis got him his next major film, ""Blue Velvet,"" an idiosyncratic murder mystery starring Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper. Lynch's subsequent films, for the most part, were similarly dream-like in their narrative and presentation: ""Wild at Heart,"" ""Lost Highway,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Inland Empire."" But his biggest imprint on the popular zeitgeist was with the 1990 TV series ""Twin Peaks,"" about the investigation into a teenage girl's murder. A wonderfully moody drama, it blended the form of TV soap operas with the paranormal, all in the deceptively tranquil setting of a Pacific Northwest logging town. Though only on ABC for two seasons, it spawned a feature film spinoff, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,"" and a follow-up series on Showtime, in 2017. Despite being the director of some dark movies, Lynch called himself a ""bliss ninny."" A longtime practitioner of transcendental meditation (or TM), in 2005 he began the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace. One of its goals: to teach students how to meditate. Lynch told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2016that he vividly remembers his very first experience with TM: ""I started meditation on July 1, 1973, on a sunny Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. I remember it as if it was yesterday. And it was so beautiful. I've been meditating twice a day for over 41 years and never missed a meditation. ""People see things like stress, traumatic stress, tension, anxiety, sorrow, depression, hate, anger and fear start to lift away,"" Lynch said. ""So, it's like pure gold coming in from within, and garbage going on."" In the 1960s,Sam Moore(Oct. 12, 1935-Jan. 10, 2025) was one half of soul music's most explosive duo, Sam & Dave, who were known as ""double dynamite"" and ""the sultans of sweat."" Their string of 10 straight Top 20 R&B hits included two soul masterpieces, ""Hold On, I'm Comin',"" ""and ""Soul Man."" Moore developed his pleading tenor voice while singing in church (he initially wanted to become a preacher). In 1957, he was set to travel to Chicago to replace the great Sam Cooke in a gospel group, The Soul Stirrers. But then,he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2014, he attended a Jackie Wilson concert: ""He was singing and winking and blinking and gyrating the body. ... I saw men screaming, women, and I said, I want to do that!"" laughed Moore. He ended up hiding from the gospel group, who left for Chicago without him. ""They had to, because they couldn't find me!"" he laughed. Moore met Dave Prater at a Miami nightclub, and their routine came together by accident. The two didn't even rehearse. ""It was all spontaneous. … We used the stage in the nightclubs like a pulpit. I preached. You would hear people from the audience go, 'Say it, Sam. Tell the truth, Sam.'"" Producer Jerry Wexler later caught their act, signed the duo to Atlantic Records, then sent them to Memphis, where Stax Records paired Sam & Dave with two young songwriters, Dave Porter and Isaac Hayes. The team turned out such hits as ""Soul Man,"" ""You Got Me Hummin,'"" ""Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,"" ""When Something Is Wrong with My Baby,"" ""I Thank You,"" ""Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody,"" and ""Soul Sister Brown Sugar."" Moore's relationship with Prater was tumultuous, and never recovered after Prater shot and wounded his own wife in a domestic dispute in 1968. Moore recalled that he told Prater, ""'I'll sing, I'll even record with you. But I'll never talk to you again. Never. And I didn't for 12-and-a-half years. Didn't."" (Prater died in a car accident in 1988.) Moore continued to tour, and in 2006 released the album ""Overnight Sensational,"" in which he performed alongside such artists as Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Sting, Billy Preston and Eric Clapton. He also recorded a tribute to George Jones with the country band Nu-Blu. In 1992 Moore and (posthumously) Prater were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He told ""Sunday Morning"" that he had always been uncomfortable being called the original ""Soul Man."" ""But I know this: at the end of the night, before I leave the stage, I better do 'Soul Man.' Gotta do it. Do I get tired? Ya, but you know what? When they go into it and I look up and see them jumpin' up and down, it all leaves."" David Morgan is senior producer for CBSNews.com and the Emmy Award-winning ""CBS News Sunday Morning."" He writes about film, music and the arts. He is author of the books ""Monty Python Speaks"" and ""Knowing the Score,"" and editor of ""Sundancing,"" about the Sundance Film Festival.",2025-03-22 00:53:35
www.cbsnews.com,The Scott Peterson case: New evidence?,https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/scott-peterson-new-evidence/,"December 18, 2024 / 8:32 PM EST/ CBS News What started out as a college romance ended in murder and mystery. 1994–Scott Petersonand Laci Rocha met in 1994 while both were attending college at California Polytechnic State University. They married two years later. In 2002, Laci became pregnant. The two lived in Modesto, California and planned to raise their unborn son Conner there. December 24, 2002– Scott Peterson says that on Christmas Eve morning, he left his pregnant wife alone to go fishing about 90 miles away at the Berkeley Marina. He says that Laci planned to walk the couple's dog, McKenzie, and mop the kitchen floor. When Scott returned home hours later, he says he found McKenzie there alone, still wearing a leash – but no sign of Laci. That evening, Laci's stepfather called the police to report her missing. Family, friends, and volunteers launched a huge search for Laci Peterson. Scott Peterson was interviewed by police in the early hours of Christmas Day.  Now-retired Modesto Police Detective Jon Buehler says Scott didn't seem as interested as one would expect. ""Oftentimes, a victim who's left behind is firing tons of questions at us … And we didn't get any of that from him,"" Buehler told ""48 Hours."" December 30, 2002– Less than a week after Laci Peterson went missing, Modesto detectives raced over to investigate an intriguing lead: a Fresno massage therapist named Amber Frey revealed that she had been dating Scott Peterson for over a month. She told police that Peterson had lied to her and said he was single. Former Detective Buehler notes, ""Her recall was fantastic. It was almost like it was a script from a Hallmark TV show or something."" Amber Frey recalled every detail of their romantic dates, down to what they were wearing. Hoping for clues that might lead them to the missing woman, detectives ask Frey to record phone calls between her and Scott Peterson, and she agrees. January 24, 2003– In an explosive press conference one month after Laci Peterson goes missing, Amber Frey publicly reveals her affair with Scott Peterson. ""I am very sorry for Laci's family and the pain that this has caused them,"" she said. ""And I pray for her safe return, as well."" Prior to Frey going public, Peterson had told her in a recorded call that he was in Paris when he was really in Modesto while the search for Laci was still on.  Eventually Scott admitted to her, ""I've lied to you that I've been traveling."" Those recorded calls would later become part of a damning case against Peterson. April 13 and 14, 2003– Two bodies are found on the shores of the San Francisco Bay. They are later identified as Laci Peterson and her unborn child. The two bodies were found about a mile apart. April 18, 2003– Authorities caught up with Scott Peterson at a golf course in San Diego and arrested him. Authorities found a wad of cash, his brother's ID card, and multiple cell phones inside the vehicle. Days later, Peterson pleaded not guilty to two counts of capital murder. June 1, 2004 –Scott Peterson's trial begins in San Mateo County, California. Because of massive publicity the trial was moved from Modesto to Redwood City, in San Mateo County. The decision was made because the judge decided it would be difficult for Peterson to get a fair trial too close to home, where emotions were running high. August 10, 2004– In what many consider a major turning point of the trial, Amber Frey took the stand for the first time to tell the jury about her relationship with Scott Peterson, a secretly married man, and about all the lies he told her. Frey painted a picture of a dishonest man who could tell falsehoods with ease, hurting his credibility. Jurors heard the lies for themselves in those recorded phone calls Frey made. November 12, 2004– Scott Peterson was found guilty of first-degree murder for the death of his wife Laci and second-degree murder for the death of his unborn son Conner. Crowds outside cheer. March 16, 2005– Four months after his conviction, Scott Peterson is sentenced to death.  At a press conference, Juror No. 7, Richelle Nice, [pictured center] called Peterson a ""jerk"" and commented ""San Quentin is your new home,"" referring to the prison where he would serve his sentence. Nice was nicknamed ""Strawberry Shortcake"" during the trial because of her hair color. August 24, 2020 –After two appeals,Scott Peterson's death sentence was overturnedby the California Supreme Court after deciding that the original trial judge made a mistake when jurors were being picked for trial. The result of that mistake, Peterson's supporters say, was that the jury was stacked with pro death penalty jurors. Peterson, shown here in 2018, will now receive a new trial for only the sentence phase. The court upheld his murder convictions. October 14, 2020– The California Supreme Court orders a lower court to reexamine Peterson's murder convictions and decide if he should get an entire new trial. Scott Peterson's supporters say it all comes down to the actions of that juror once nicknamed ""Strawberry Shortcake"" – Richelle Nice, pictured here in 2005. During jury selection, prospective jurors filled out a questionnaire asking if they had in the past been in a lawsuit and if they had been crime victims.  Nice checked no.  ""It's pretty clear… that she lied to us straight to our face about her own situation,"" Peterson's current attorney Pat Harris told ""48 Hours.""  In fact, Nice was involved in two domestic disputes in the past. But prosecutors say when Nice filled out that questionnaire she didn't lie, she just didn't think her past experiences were relevant to the questions and didn't see herself as a victim. Now a lower court will consider if Peterson will get a complete retrial.  Richelle Nice declined to speak with ""48 Hours."" March 7, 2021– CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti interviewed Scott Peterson's sister-in-law Janey Peterson in her ""war room"" of evidence she claims proves his innocence. She claims witnesses saw Laci walking in the neighborhood near the Peterson homeafterthe time Scott said he left for the fishing trip. If that's true, Scott couldn't have killed Laci. Scott Peterson's attorney explains, ""there's been a lot of criticism because we didn't call some witnesses who saw Laci that day,"" and that the thought process at the time was that ""a number of the witnesses who saw her didn't have great   – memories or had contra    – were contradicting each other."" Retired detective Jon Buehler says there are no witnesses who saw Laci alive that morning.  He says there were other young women in the neighborhood who were pregnant and looked similar to Laci, and that ""it would be real easy for somebody to mistakenly see one of those three girls as being Laci.""  Still, Janey Peterson insists that Scott is innocent. Perhaps more important to a new defense case is what Janey Peterson believes actually happened to Laci. She points to a burglary she believes happened on the same day Laci disappeared, right across the street from the Peterson home. Scott Peterson's supporters theorize that Laci confronted the burglars and that ended badly.  But police quickly arrested the burglars – Steven Todd and Donald Pearce   – pictured here in a 2003 Modesto Police Department press release. April 27, 2021– Scott Peterson appeared in court remotely for a status hearing on a new death penalty trial. Dec. 8, 2021:Scott Peterson was resentencedto life in prison without the possibility of parole for the deaths of his wife and unborn child. 2024:The Los Angeles Innocence Project  took up Peterson's fight for a new trial.  Since then, a California judge has granted his defense team access to previously undisclosed evidence as well as permission to do additional DNA testing. Peterson and his supporters maintain the wrong man is in prison for Laci and Conner's deaths.  According to Detective Buehler, ""Well, I guess it's possible. But you know, there's still people that believe the Earth is flat too.""",2025-03-22 00:53:37
www.cbsnews.com,The troubled marriage of Ashley and Doug Benefield,https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/ashley-benefield-doug-benefield-troubled-marriage-photos/,"December 3, 2024 / 1:36 PM EST/ CBS News The seesaw marriage between the former ballerina and her much older husband only lasted four years, until she shot him on Sept. 27, 2020. Ashley Byers met Doug Benefieldat a dinner in Florida in August 2016 and sparks flew immediately. Ashley was 24 and a former ballerina and swimsuit model. Doug was 54 and worked as a consultant for technology companies and government contractors. The couple married 13 days later in his hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, in front of very few guests Doug didn't tell Eva, his 15-year-old daughter from his previous marriage., that he and Ashley had married. Eva's mother Renee had died of an undiagnosed heart ailment nine months earlier. Ashley struggled to get along with Eva, right, and her friend, Sydney, who moved in with the family. During an argument with Ashley about Eva, Doug fired his gun into the kitchen ceiling. But Doug continued to support Ashley in her dream of building a ballet company in Charleston. The American National Ballet would be a more inclusive home to dancers who were considered unconventional. While they were building the ballet company, Ashley became pregnant. She began to suffer from nausea and returned to Florida so her mother could take care of her. A month later, in September 2017, Ashley and her mother returned to Charleston. She packed up her belongings and left a scathing note. Ashley called Doug ""possessive"" and ""controlling."" She wrote that the incident when Doug had fired a gun into the ceiling as well as other unsafe behavior had left her fearful for her life and the safety of her unborn child. In October, Ashley left the ballet company and new leadership fired half of the dancers. Ashley posted on the ballet's social media pages that she was devastated, and that the new leadership destroyed all that they worked so hard to build. Ashley then told authorities about the gun incident. Child Protective Services investigated and interviewed Eva. Doug was evaluated by a psychologist and ultimately cleared. Ashley also claimed Doug poisoned her and his first wife, Renee. Renee's autopsy says she died of coronary artery sclerosis, a heart condition. Ashley had no contact with Doug for the rest of her pregnancy despite his pleas to be involved. In March 2018, three weeks before her due date, she checked into the hospital and said her husband had poisoned her. Doctors performed a C-section and delivered a healthy baby girl. Doug didn't know she'd been born. After Ashley filed court documents to keep Doug away from her and their daughter, a judge weighed in on the case. She found ""There is not a single scintilla of credible evidence that Ms. Benefield has ever been poisoned or suffered from any illness of any poison."" Doug and Ashley began sharing custody of their daughter when she was 6 months old. Doug and Ashley appeared to put their differences behind them, and reconciled for much of 2019. The two spent time together with their daughter In August 2019, Ashley showed up to drop off their daughter; she was wearing what Doug thought was an engagement ring. Doug hired a private investigator, who said Ashley was seeing someone else. Doug filed for divorce. Ashley then accused him of physically and sexually abusing their daughter.  Doug denied the allegations and CPS found no evidence of abuse. In the summer of 2020, Ashley and Doug suddenly reconciled again and announced they were moving to Maryland with their daughter and Ashley's mother. On September 27, 2020, Doug was packing a U-Haul with the family's possessions. That night a neighbor called 911 to report a shooting at the home. Ashley had walked to his house holding a .45 caliber gun and said Doug had attacked her and she shot him. Doug died an hour later at a local hospital. Ashley was arrested on Nov. 4, 2020 and charged with second-degree murder. She pleaded not guilty and posted bond a few weeks later. On July 30, 2024, Ashley Benefield wasfound guilty of manslaughterwith a firearm in the shooting death of her estranged husband Doug Benefield. On Dec. 3, 2024, Ashley Benefield was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to be followed by 10 years of probation.",2025-03-22 00:53:38
www.cbsnews.com,Texas couple investigates teen daughter's unusual death,https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/cayley-mandadi-death-final-hours-photos/,"December 1, 2024 / 1:58 AM EST/ CBS News Cayley Mandadi,19, was a typical Texas teenager navigating life through school, sports and boys. Friends say she had a big heart and was ""full of love."" Her mother says Cayley was a happy person who was trusting, warm and always smiling. Mandadi was a sophomore studying communications at Trinity University, a small liberal arts college in San Antonio, Texas. In the fall of 2017, friends say Mandadi finally felt like she was fitting in at school. She joined a sorority and was a member of the Trinity cheerleading team. Mandadi dated Trinity student and football player Jett Birchum her freshman year. But the relationship was on again, off again. There was another man in  Mandadi's life – 22-year-old Mark Howerton. Growing up, Howerton had been a star high school baseball player. Howerton was not a student at Trinity, but often visited his friends on campus. That's how he met Mandadi. By October 2017 their friendship turned into a romantic relationship. Howerton and  Mandadi's relationship quickly turned rocky. According to campus police, a few weeks before her death, Howerton tore apart Mandadi's dorm room. After having an argument, Howerton reportedly threw her clothes in the trees, cracked a sliding glass door and later smashed her laptop. The Trinity University Police Department was called to the scene and Howerton was banned from campus. The last weekend of October 2017 Mandadi and  Howerton attended the Mala Luna Music Festival in San Antonio. The couple took MDMA, a drug known as Molly or ecstasy. This photo was taken at the music festival. According to Howerton, on Sunday, Oct. 29, 2017, the couple left Mala Luna sometime after 4 p.m. They got in an argument after seeing Mandadi's ex-boyfriend, Jett Birchum, at the festival. Howerton said they continued to argue in the car, but eventually stopped at a parking lot to have ""rough"" make-up sex. Howerton would later tell police that sometime after having sex, Mandadi stopped breathing. At some point he brought her to the emergency room. When Howerton arrived at the emergency room,  Mandadi was in the passenger seat of his car, nearly naked and unconscious. A paramedic testified that she saw ""multiple bruises"" on Mandadi's legs and immediately started CPR. While doctors tried to save Mandadi's life, officers on the sceneinterviewed Mark Howertonabout what happened that night. They took this photo of his hands, Three months after Mandadi's death, her autopsy report was released. It showed that she died from blunt force trauma to the face and head, and labeled her death a homicide. Several weeks later,Howerton was arrested and charged with murderand sexual assault. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. In December 2019, Howerton went on trial in San Antonio for the murder of Mandadi. ""This is a case where, there's more than meets the eye and things aren't what they seem,"" John Hunter, Howerton's defense attorney, told ""48 Hours."" During the trial, Birchum, told the jury what he witnessed at the Mala Luna Music Festival. He testified that he saw Howerton and Mandadi ""having an intense conversation"" and Mandadi ""trying to create space"" and ""get away."" He said he then witnessed Howerton, ""reach out his right arm and hook it around her shoulder and pull her in closer. And then turn and walk away."" During cross-examination, Hunter grilled Birchum about what he says he saw that day. Birchum originally told police that he saw Howerton pick Mandadi up and put her in his car as they were leaving the festival. On the stand, Birchum admitted to misleading police about this, testifying that he didn't actually see Howerton put Mandadi in his car. The defense presents a different theory of how Mandadi sustained her injuries that day. They argue Mandadi's bruises were at the hands of the medical staff and not Howerton. They say the cause was from the organ donation process and when medical professionals desperately tried to revive Mandadi seven times, they broke one of her ribs and bruised her body. After 10 hours of deliberations over two days, the jury notified the judge that they were unable to come to a decision. A mistrial was declared. While prosecutors planned to retry Howerton, Cayley's mother Alison Steele (pictured) and stepfather Lawrence Baitland decided the jury needed more information about what happened inside Howerton's car. Steele and Baitland focused on an autopsy photo showing a bruise in the shape of a small dot above Cayley's right ear and another larger bruise above Cayley's left ear. Steele says they believe Cayley's fatal injury took place when Howerton ""reached from his driver's seat, hit her in the left ear and drove her head into the window and onto the lock button of the car."" Steele and Baitland went to a used car lot where Steele posed in a car like the Mercedes Howerton drove the night Cayley was killed. This is one of the many photos Baitland took of Steele posing in the car. He told ""48 Hours"" he ""photographed her head in different positions while … holding the autopsy images, trying to see if they match up with the door and it's a near perfect match."" Emboldened by the photos he took, Lawrence Baitland, a NASA engineer, constructed a 3D model of  Mandadi's head. He layered in photos of Cayley and the autopsy photo showing that dot above Cayley's right ear. ""So this gave me the confidence to go to the next step, which was to seek out the killer's car,"" Baitland said. Bailtlandtracked down Howerton's Mercedes. He convinced the owner to sell him the car. Baitland and Steele then hired a private investigator who produced a reenactment video of what they believe happened in the car with actors similar in size to Mandadi and Howerton. This is a still frame of that video. Howerton is seen attending court at the start of his second trial in May of 2023. The prosecution decided not to enter Steele and Baitland's reenactment video into evidence, concerned that the defense cross-examination about it might undermine the case. The jury did not find Howerton guilty of murder, but rather aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He was sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison. He is eligible for parole in May of 2033 Alison Steele turned her grief into action. In September 2019, she was able to get theCLEAR Alert Billpassed. Now in the state of Texas when someone between the ages of 18-64 goes missing, an emergency text will go out to the community. Steele wants                   ""Cayley's story to be used to help other people."" Taylor Clement will never forget her best friend. She told ""48 Hours"" that she had always planned to have Mandadi as her maid of honor in her wedding someday, and the godmother to her future children. She said this photo of them ""smiling at prom is [her] absolute favorite.""",2025-03-22 00:53:41
