# Natural Language Understanding Debugging Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Confirmed that `BACKEND_URL` correctly points to the running FastAPI backend
   - Updated port from 8000 to 8001 to avoid conflicts

2. **Keyword Handling**
   - Added proper sanitization for keywords extracted from queries
   - Added logging to track the sanitized keywords
   - Limited to 5 keywords maximum for more focused results

3. **Search Endpoint**
   - Fixed the search implementation to match the expected format
   - Added pagination with limit parameter to prevent timeouts
   - Updated error handling to return empty results instead of errors

4. **Database Structure**
   - Validated that the `news` table exists with test_db_structure.py
   - Confirmed that the `news_information` column exists and contains data
   - Fixed table name issues in the backend (changed from `news_articles` to `news`)

5. **Enhanced Debugging**
   - Added detailed logging for HTTP requests and responses
   - Added response status code and content type logging
   - Added error catching for JSON parsing issues

6. **Fallback Logic**
   - Improved fallback article search with better error handling
   - Added verification of article structure before processing
   - Enhanced mock data generation for when no articles are found

## Next Steps

1. **Load Testing**
   - Test the system with high query volumes to ensure stability
   - Monitor database connection for timeouts

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Consider adding full-text search for better performance
   - Implement caching for frequent searches

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection for understanding system performance
   - Set up alerts for high error rates or timeouts
